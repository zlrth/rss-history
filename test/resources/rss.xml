			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three things happened today that created a sort of nuclear reaction in my head. The result was a rather blinding flash of insight concerning a set of knotty problems I am wrangling with. The first thing was a reaction, from a colleague, to a whirlwind burst of activity I put in last night to react to an opportunity. The second was an unusual compliment from another colleague. The third was a pre-release review copy of John Kotter&#8217;s upcoming <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422179710?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1422179710" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">A Sense of Urgency</a></em><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1422179710" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> arriving in the mail today (the book will be released in September, but if you are reading an article about urgency, shouldn&#8217;t you pre-order?)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>Somehow the raw material brought me one of my increasingly rare moments of clarity (my last Aha! of comparable magnitude was 2 years ago). Condensed to a sound-bite, my insight can be summed up as follows: <em>for your business to win today, you must adopt acceleration as your strategy, and urgency as your doctrine.</em> Let me explain, via some bigger bite-sized thoughts.</p>
<p><span id="more-315"></span></p>
<p><strong>One: Some Compliments Validating <em>Ready-Fire-Aim</em><br />
</strong></p>
<p>I most appreciate compliments that pick out specific behaviors and validate my sense of what is the smartest way to work and deliver, and these are rare enough that I remember them all. My way, of course, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470182024?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470182024" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">Ready, Fire, Aim</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0470182024" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> (RFA).</p>
<p>In the last five years, I&#8217;ve only received RFA-related compliments five times. Here are three that will make sense without more context. Oddly enough, two of them arrived today.</p>
<p>The furious burst of opportunity-intersecting activity that kept me up last night led to an emailed compliment from a colleague that began: <em>Venkat, When do you sleep!  I am amazed by &#8230;</em></p>
<p>The second one was from another colleague, who I respect a lot, but who I hadn&#8217;t connected with in a while. He opened his getting-back-in-touch email with a bit of wry self-deprecation: <em>we met a couple of times at the beginning, but you very quickly and correctly realized that I could not be of help at the speed at which you operate.</em></p>
<p>And the third one, from several months ago, which I can&#8217;t quote verbatim, is from a phenomenal programmer who had just joined my team, and to whom I&#8217;d sent some very dense, focused emails: <em>for somebody who talks so much, you pack an awful lot of information into what you say, and I mean that as a compliment.</em></p>
<p>Here is why I so value these compliments: they acknowledge what I call my <em>ready-fire-aim</em> mentality,  something I worked really hard to acquire. As you probably know if you read this blog regularly, my more natural mode of operation is armchair philosopher. Boiler-room style RFA does not come naturally to me, which means I operate these days largely via bouts of lethargy punctuated by bursts of action. Call it a schizoid lifestyle, but so far, it hasn&#8217;t killed me.</p>
<p><strong>Two: Leaps of Faith and Opportunism</strong></p>
<p>I talked a little bit about how I learned this style of operating in my piece: <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/06/20/the-three-leaps-of-faith-rule/">The Three-Leaps-Of-Faith Rule</a>. When your ability to make leaps of faith becomes routine, that is when you are ready to start operating in opportunistic mode, and I wrote about that in <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/12/05/the-fine-art-of-opportunism/">The Fine Art of Opportunism</a>.</p>
<p>Think about this learning curve: learning to drive a car; learning to change lanes carefully; learning to safely but rapidly change lanes nearly constantly, in heavy traffic, to beat the overall flow rate of the highway (I don&#8217;t drive this way by the way; I am not that good a driver, but I&#8217;ve ridden, mildly panicked, with people who are).</p>
<p><strong>Three: Urgency, Acceleration and Emotion</strong></p>
<p>You breathe harder going from 0-60 mph in 15 seconds than you do cruising at 80mph for 15 seconds. Acceleration and deceleration create emotions. Deceleration creates despair, but let&#8217;s not talk about that. Acceleration creates urgency and exhilaration. When consequential things are involved, you only have urgency. But a sense of urgency is not a bad thing. As Kotter notes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It is often believed that people cannot maintain a high sense of urgency over a prolonged period of time without burnout.  Yet, with all the alertness, initiative and speed, true urgency doesn&#8217;t produce dangerous levels of stress.</p>
<p>He goes on to note that besides the clarity of focus that accompanies true urgency, true urgency also makes the art of prioritization trivially easy. When you run into a grizzly bear while hiking, you <em>know</em> that saving your backpack isn&#8217;t important. Black and white. When you are changing lanes rapidly in heavy unsteady traffic, you <em>know</em> that your cellphone conversation with the President of the United States isn&#8217;t important. At least I hope you do. False urgency doesn&#8217;t have this natural release valve of being able to recognize and drop the contextually unimportant.</p>
<p>In the world of business, as Kotter explains, communicating that <em>emotion</em> of urgency is what separates failed attempts at change from successful ones.</p>
<p><strong>Four: The Doctrine of Urgency</strong></p>
<p>I explained my rather fussy semantics around the words <em>strategy, tactics, doctrine and operations</em> <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/09/24/strategy-tactics/">in this piece</a>. Doctrine to me is a set of beliefs. Kotter&#8217;s idea of urgency is an element of an extremely good doctrine for businesses in 2008:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;What is the single biggest error people make when they try to change?&#8230; They did not create a high enough sense of urgency among enough people to set the stage for making a challenging leap into some new direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>This belief would make my top 3. Curiously enough, in my own piece cited above, I chose to illustrate the idea of doctrine with one from the US military that is along the same lines. Quoting myself:<em> </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The idea in the US military that one must control the tempo of a military engagement is an element of<em> doctrine</em> (hence “shock and awe”).</p>
<p><strong>Five: Strategies of Acceleration</strong></p>
<p>By <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/09/24/strategy-tactics/">my semantics</a>, strategy refers to what-if stories about the future. Successful strategies come in many genres, but there is a class of success stories that could be called <em>acceleration stories,</em> that share with pulp-fiction thrillers the same acceleration-with-emotion signature.</p>
<p>My first moment of dim awareness of this came via an excellent heuristic that a colleague (the same one who complimented my dense emails) shared with me about team building: <em>when I think about whether or not to add someone to the team, I ask myself, &#8220;will he/she slow us down, or speed us up?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the kind of anecdote you encounter in acceleration stories. Kotter gets this too, he characterizes people who &#8220;get&#8221; urgency doctrines as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They don&#8217;t move at 35 mph when 65 mph is needed to win.</p>
<p>In growth initiatives, we focus too much on scaling and actual structural growth, and too little on the essential dynamic: <em>acceleration.</em> Remember, growth can be a slowing growth. Acceleration, not growth is the signature of innovation. I&#8217;ll take a small team that is moving a little bit faster every day over a larger team that is grinding to a halt. People and money aren&#8217;t the ultimate resources in business. The ability to accelerate is.</p>
<p>I had the rare opportunity of watching a night launch of the space shuttle a few months ago. That is an awe-inspiring sight; acceleration at its most potent. You watch as some lumbering megatons of metal and fuel, stuff that was moving to the launchpad painfully slowly on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawler-Transporter" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">crawler</a> at 1 mph just days before, suddenly, within minutes, drives skywards to escape velocity, with a huge flame attached at the bottom (you have to see this to believe it &#8212; the fire plume is really <em>huge, </em>like skyscraper huge).</p>
<p>This kind of bottle-rocket acceleration to escape velocity, of course, is rarely needed. What you need is the acceleration capacity for lane-changing and overtaking in a competitive world. More on bottle rockets in the last section.</p>
<p>Acceleration, to continue the driving/lane changing metaphor from parts 2 and 3, isn&#8217;t just pointless thrill-seeking. It is what you need to keep moving in a world slowly grinding to a gridlock of complacency.  Or a furious, honking, road-raging gridlock.</p>
<p><strong>Six: False Urgency </strong></p>
<p>Kotter has plenty to say about both tired, quiet, complacent gridlocks and furious, road-raging false urgency. He gets almost Shakespearean in describing false urgency:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8230;[E]mployees scramble: sprinting, meeting, task-forcing, emailing &#8212; all of which create a howling wind of activity&#8230;that destroys much and creates nothing.</p>
<p>Recall this famous bit from Macbeth, Act 5, Scene 5</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<br />
To the last syllable of recorded time,<br />
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br />
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br />
Life&#8217;s but a walking shadow, a poor player<br />
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br />
And then is heard no more: it is a tale<br />
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br />
Signifying nothing.</p>
<p>I never cease to be amazed by Shakespeare. Though he was talking about something else entirely, he still managed to accidentally describe <em>both</em> complacency and false urgency in one eloquent verse.</p>
<p>Shakespeare A+, though he wasn&#8217;t taking this test. Kotter A-. But more practically, Kotter notes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With a false sense of urgency, an organization does have a great deal of energized action, but it is driven by anxiety, anger and frustration, and not a focused determination to win as soon as is reasonably possible.</p>
<p><strong>Seven: <em>Carpe Diem!</em> on the High Seas<br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Poets_Society" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">Dead Poets Society</a>, it should be obvious to you, is one of my favorite movies. The first glimpse we get of the visceral, acceleration-oriented <em>carpe diem</em> style of the charismatic teacher, John Keating (a surprisingly non-hammy Robin Williams), is when he gets his students to tear out, from a volume of poetry, the stodgy bureacratic introduction by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, PhD.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what a doctrine of urgency, driving a strategy of acceleration, looks like. There is some destruction, and you better have a <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/07/21/towards-a-philosophy-of-destruction/">philosophy of destruction</a> handy, to save your sanity.</p>
<p>It is no accident that a naval metaphor is part of DPS: Keating has his students to address him <em>O Captain, my Captain.</em> Whitman&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Captain%21_My_Captain%21" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">O Captain, My Captain</a> </em>(itself an allegory about Lincoln&#8217;s assassination) plays a key role in the narrative.  Another great naval metaphor: <em>clear the decks for action! </em></p>
<p>And think about all those steamship-era naval stories, where a furious race is won by one captain running out of coal and using the stateroom wooden furniture to keep the fires blazing. False urgency is more like rearranging the deck chairs on the <em>Titanic</em>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like individual, urgency-creating, charismatic Captain figures though &#8212; I prefer a general sense of collaborative urgency. It is more productive. Remember, in DPS, one of Keating&#8217;s pupils died.</p>
<p><strong>Eight: Agility in the Kitchen, Agility in the Sky</strong></p>
<p>Let me conclude with two more references to pieces by me. One of my personal favorite pieces is <em><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/10/25/an-mba-in-gordons-restaurant/">An MBA in Gordon&#8217;s Restaurant,</a> </em>where I tried to infer business lessons from the popular show, <em>Kitchen Nighmares. </em>In my seven-step &#8220;Ramsey&#8221; strategy for turnarounds, Step 6 was the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[In each episode]he [Ramsey] got the staff to experience success, and get high on it by creating a critical success experiment. In each case, the restaurant shut down and relaunched with some major hoopla. In each case, the staff struggled and in parts, crumbled, dealing with the onslaught of customers pouring in. In each case, this remark was made: “this staff doesn’t know what it is like to be busy.” In each case operational inefficiencies were immediately exposed and corrected in war mode.<em> Translation: Get people to experience what success feels like, even if only for a day.</em></p>
<p>Again, that&#8217;s what the urgency-acceleration combination <em>feels</em> like.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s me quote myself one final time, from my review of  <em><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/11/05/the-age-of-speed-by-vince-poscente/">The Age of Speed,</a> </em>by Vince Poscente (an equally useful and equally little book on the same theme, but very different in style and message &#8212; it is more about exhilaration than urgency). This should also help think about space shuttle launches versus agile highway overtaking.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Poscente posits four personality types in organizations. Classify yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Zeppelins</em>:<em> </em>resist speed and try to slow things down when things start speeding up to the point where they lose control.</li>
<li><em>Balloons:</em> don’t resist speed, but exit the game and find a niche for themselves where they can live a slow-paced life. Balloons are the uniquely skilled people who are not needed in commodity quantities in the economy.</li>
<li><em>Bottle rockets:</em> are speed-at-all-costs individuals with zero agility who are both dangerous and uncontrolled/uncontrollable, and go out with a bang and collapse.</li>
<li><em>Jets</em>: are fast <em>and </em>agile enough to make speed worth it.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Obviously I am a jet and most of you are zeppelins. Okay, I think I am actually a balloon at heart.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;d add a caveat that even bottle rockets are good, if they can get to escape velocity and launch a satellite before they go out with a bang. Hmm&#8230; maybe I&#8217;ve been enlightened all along, and today I just got myself some meta-enlightenment about having been enlightened all along.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somewhere in the back of our minds, we know that creation and growth must be accompanied by destruction and decline. We pay lip service to this essential dichotomy, or attempt to avoid it altogether, by using false-synthesis weasel words like <em>renewal</em>. I too have been guilty of this, as in this <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/02/06/creative-destruction-portrait-of-an-idea/">romanticized treatment of creative destruction</a> (though I think that was a fine piece overall). Though I define innovation as &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; in the sense of Schumpeter, most of the time I spend thinking about this subject is devoted to creativity and growth.  The reasons for this asymmetry are not hard to find. Destruction is often associated (and conflated) with evil. More troubling &#8212; it is often associated with pain, even if there is no evil intent involved. Finally, destruction &#8212; let&#8217;s loosely define it as any entropy-increasing process &#8212; is also more likely to happen naturally. It therefore requires less deliberate attention, and is easier to deny and ignore. Still, the subject of destruction does deserve, say, at least 1/5 the attention that creation commands. A thoughtful philosophy of destruction is essential to a rich life, at the very least because each of us must  grapple with his/her own mortality. So here is a quick introduction to non-evil destruction, within the context of business and innovation. Before we begin, lodge this prototypical example of creative destruction, the game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">Jenga</a>, in your mind:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_304" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jenga.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-304" title="jenga" src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jenga.gif" alt="Jenga (Wikimedia Commons)" width="150" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jenga (Wikimedia Commons)</p></div></p>
<p><span id="more-303"></span></p>
<p><strong>Destruction in Business and Innovation<br />
</strong></p>
<p>It is relatively easy to separate out obviously <em>evil</em> destruction (Hitler, 9/11). It is also easy to separate out non-evil and non-painful destruction (demolition of unsafe, derelict buildings, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">controlled burns</a> to contain the risk of forest fires&#8230;). Here are three gray-area examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version 6.2 of your company&#8217;s great software, everybody recognizes, represents an end-of-life technology (for example, a famous product beginning with <em>V</em> and ending in <em>ista</em>). Layers of band-aid bug-fixes and patches have destroyed the architectural integrity of the original product. You must make the painful decision of completely discarding it and starting with a clean-sheet design based on a more advanced architecture. Maybe some key employees, for whom the product represents their life work, and who still believe in it, quit in bitter disappointment, seething with a sense of betrayal.</li>
<li>Widget Inc. has an old legacy product <em>A,</em> that is nearing the end of its design life. Most new investment is going towards a new product <em>B, </em>that requires a completely new set of business and technical competencies. There is buzz and excitement around <em>B, </em>while <em>A</em> is surrounded by an atmosphere of quiet despair <em>. </em>You gradually stop hiring <em>A-</em>relevant skills and increase hiring of <em>B-</em>relevant skills. A population of employees, too old or too set in its ways to learn new skills, is left providing legacy system support as the product slowly dies out of the economy. As CEO, you eventually offer a very attractive trade-in program to the few remaining customers, stop support, and lay off the few remaining employees who don&#8217;t adapt.</li>
<li>What do you think of all the great (including life-saving) technology that came out of both the Allied and Axis sides of World War II (radar, microwaves, rocketry, computing, jet engines, the Volkswagen Beetle)? Is it morally possible to appreciate these technologies without condoning Hitler?</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples illustrate the complexity of thinking about destruction. All reasonable people, I suspect, try to simplify things and operate with an attitude of kindness and gentleness. But does the world always allow our <em>actions</em> to be kind or gentle?</p>
<p><strong>The Phenomenology of Destruction</strong></p>
<p>Creation and growth can be gradual, steady, linear and calm, but this is rarely the case. More often, we either see head-spinning Kool-Aid exponential dynamics, critical-mass effects, tipping points and the like. Or slowing, diminishing-returns effects. Steady progress is a myth.</p>
<p>Destruction is the same way. We&#8217;d <em>like</em> all destruction to be strictly necessary, linear and peaceful. That&#8217;s why phrases like <em>graceful degradation</em> are engineering favorites. That&#8217;s why my friend and animal rights activist <a href="http://www.vegan.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.vegan.com');">Erik Marcus</a> champions <em>dismantlement</em> of animal agriculture rather than its destruction. The world unfortunately, rarely behaves that way. Our rich vocabulary around destruction is an indication of this: <em>decay, rot, neglect, catastrophe, failure mode, buckle, shatter, collapse, death, life-support, apocalypse. </em>Destruction isn&#8217;t this messy simply because we are unkind or evil. Destruction is fundamentally messy, and keeping it gentle takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>I once read that nearly 70% of deaths are painful (no clue whether this is true, but much as <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/07/06/happy-first-birthday-ribbonfarm/">my first experience of euthanasia</a> hurt, I still believe in it). Reliability engineering provides some clues as to why this is so &#8212; <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> had <a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/sep04/4975" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.spectrum.ieee.org');">this excellent cover story</a> a few years ago, analyzing biological death from a reliability engineering perspective. The shorter version:  complex systems admit cascading, exponentially-increasing failure modes that are hard to contain. Any <em>specific</em> failure can be contained and corrected, but as failures pile on top of failures, and the body starts to weaken and destabilize overall as a system, doctors can scramble, but eventually cannot keep up. The shortest version: &#8220;He died of complications following heart surgery.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jenga as Metaphor</strong></p>
<p>The game of Jenga illustrates why it is so hard to keep destruction to linear-dismantlement forms. Once you throw in an element of creation in parallel (removing blocks and stacking them on top to make the tower higher), you are constrained. If you had the luxury of time, you could unstack all the blocks carefully, and restack them in a taller, &#8220;hollow&#8221; configuration with only 2 bricks per layer. That&#8217;s graceful reconstruction. The world rarely allows us to do this.  We must reconstruct the tower while deconstructing it, and eventually the growth creates the kind of brittle complexity where further attempts at growth cause collapse.</p>
<p>Milton, the real star of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">Office Space</a>,</em> provides a more true-to-life example of the Jenga mode of destruction.</p>

<p>Remember how Lumberg gradually took away Milton&#8217;s work and authority, degraded his office space, took him off the payroll, stole his stapler and consigned him to the basement? When Milton ultimately snaps, he burns down the office. He escapes to a tropical island paradise with a lot of loot, but his victory does not last &#8212; waiters ignore his drink requests, causing him to mumble about further arson attempts.</p>
<p>In less dramatic forms, you can observe similar dynamics in any modern corporation. Look away from the bright glow of the new product/service lines and exciting areas with plenty of growth and cool technology. Look into the darkness that defines the halo around the new, and you&#8217;ll see the slow undermining and ongoing multi-faceted destruction of the old. Resources are moved, project priorities are lowered, incentives are handed out to the participants in the growth. Things crumble, with occasional smaller and larger collapses. Watch closely, and you will feel the actual pain. You will participate in the tragedy.</p>
<p>If you happen to be part of new growth, recognize this. One day, a brighter light will put you in the shadows, and you will have to face the mortality of your own creations. One of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agq-EdwEo3w" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.youtube.com');">my favorite Hindi songs</a> gets at this ultimately tragic, Sisyphean nature of all human creation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Main pal do pal ka shayar hun, pal do pal meri kahani hain<br />
pal do pal meri hansi hai, pal do pal meri jawaani hain</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mujhse pehle kitne shayar, aaye aur aa kar chale gaye<br />
kuch aahe bhar kar laut gaye, kuch naghme gaa kar chale gaye<br />
woh bhi ek pal ka kissa they, main bhi ek pal ka kissa hun<br />
kal tumse juda ho jaoonga, jo aaj tumhara hissa hun</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Kal aur aayenge naghmo ki, khilti kaliyan chunne wale<br />
Mujhse behtar kehne waale, tumse behtar sunne wale</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>kal koi mujhko yaad kare, kyon koi mujhko yaad kare<br />
masroof zamaana mere liye, kyon waqt apna barbaad kare?<br />
</em></p>
<p>Which roughly translates to the following (better translators, feel free to correct me):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am but a poet of a moment or two, a moment or two is as long as my story lasts<br />
My laughter is but for a moment or two, for a moment or two does my youth last<br />
</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many a poet came before me, they came and then they faded away<br />
they took a few breaths and left, they sang a few songs and left<br />
they too were but anecdotes of the moment, I  too am an  anecdote of a moment<br />
tomorrow, I will be parted from you, though today I am a part of you<br />
</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And tomorrow, there will come other pickers of blooming flower-songs<br />
Poets who speak more eloquently than I, listeners more sophisticated than you&#8230;<br />
</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Were somebody to remember me tomorrow &#8212; why would anybody remember me?<br />
this busy, preoccupied world, why should it waste its time on me?<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Life After People</strong></p>
<p>It seems likely that the universe at large is likely a place of destruction-by-entropy. Yet, on our little far-from-equilibrium home here on earth, the picture, at least for a few millenia, is one of renewal, emphasizing creation over destruction.</p>
<p>The history channel recently <a href="http://www.history.com/minisites/life_after_people" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.history.com');">aired a show</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_After_People" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">what would happen</a> to our planet if all humans were to suddenly vanish. There is also a brilliant book devoted to this thought experiment, which I am currently reading:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>Though the events in both the show and book are largely about how human-created reality would collapse, the overall story is an uplifting one of growth and renewal, as nature &#8212; not as brittle and in-danger as we like to think &#8212; gradually reclaims the human sphere.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a compelling scene in HBO&#8217;s quasi-fictional Western,  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">Deadwood</a></em>, which qualifies as an instant lesson in the essentials of talent management. The 1870s mining boom town of <em>Deadwood</em>, which is just emerging from Wild West  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">state-of-nature</a> conditions, has attracted the attention of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_%28industrialist%29" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">robber baron</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hearst" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">George Hearst</a>.   Al Swearengen, the town&#8217;s incumbent strongman, adapts nimbly and switches from a governance-by-murder strategy to a more artful one, and in the process very effectively shifts power between his two key reports to reflect the priorities of the new situation. Dan Doherty, his dim and violent second from the lawless past, is gracefully shunted aside, while the more suave, but restless and underutilized Silas Adams is handed the tricky and critical &#8220;stretch&#8221; task of managing the relationship with George Hearst. Somehow, Al keeps both men motivated and loyal.  Modern executives will recognize all sorts of very current themes in this little vignette. So how do you master these timeless elements of  talent management, while operating in modern business conditions? You read <em>Talent On Demand</em> by Wharton&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/cappelli.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.wharton.upenn.edu');">Peter Cappelli</a>, a book that completely validates my belief that talent management is <em>the</em> issue of the next decade (the purchasing function ranks a close second).</p>
<p align="center">
<p><span id="more-300"></span> <strong>The Problem of Talent Management Defined</strong></p>
<p>What makes <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/06/22/theory-w-theory-x-and-theory-y/">talent management</a> possibly the hardest, and most important problem in management is that it involves entities &#8212; people &#8212; who must at once be treated as unique one-of-a-kind items that need individualized handling, and as standardized parts in a supply chain feeding an abstract organizational structure. Consider the issues highlighted in the <em>Deadwood</em> vignette above:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is the need to focus talent development efforts on current strategic priorities</li>
<li>There is the need to treat a structural position (second-in-command) as a plug-in spot for an abstract &#8220;part&#8221; of a machine, to be replaced as necessary by a waiting inventoried item in the supply chain</li>
<li>There is the need to play to people&#8217;s strengths</li>
<li>There is the need to maintain motivation and loyalty while playing chessmaster</li>
<li>There is the need to keep an eye on retention issues</li>
<li>There is the need to grow employees through developmental experiences</li>
<li>There is the need to assume some risk and control costs by allowing mission-critical tasks to be used for development purposes (otherwise you lose too much money on expensive &#8220;pure development&#8221; assignments)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Book</strong></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an easy set of challenges. The solution, in my mind, comprises three parts &#8212; individually-tailored local management practices, which I briefly covered in my review of the <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/15/the-coming-triumph-of-the-strengths-movement/">strengths movement</a>, analytics-driven impersonal and global practices, which this book covers, and methods to balance the imperatives of strategy (the &#8220;pull&#8221;) and the capabilities of your talent (the &#8220;push&#8221;), which I&#8217;ll cover in my next article in this series (the mysterious &#8220;Theory W&#8221; I am promising)</p>
<p>The book  is in two parts. The stand-out excellent Part I covers the historical development of talent management, from the robber baron era to modern times, and concludes with a careful and pragmatic framing of the problem.  Part II, which covers four competencies that comprise Cappelli&#8217;s &#8220;On-Demand&#8221; model, is more patchy. The first two chapters of Part II, covering the build-vs.-buy issue and the problem of uncertain demand, are excellent. The last two chapters, on managing talent ROI and internal markets, are between weak to competent.</p>
<p><strong>The Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I am biased, because I am partial to history, but the best part of the book is the history bit, which manages the impossible task of being both magisterial and  succinct. We get a whistle-stop tour starting from the early days, when railroads were the best-practice leaders and everybody else poached from the Pennsylvania Railroad. The story proceeds to the diffusion of inspired <em>ad hoc</em> models, largely invented by famous names ranging from Dupont and Carnegie to Scwhab and J. P. Morgan, and carried throughout the economy by their proteges. Next we get a careful treatment of the growth and professionalization of talent management. We learn about the evolution of training models, rotational assignments, high-potential programs, succession planning, 360 degree reviews. and prediction models models at places like GE, Dupont, AT&amp;T and GM. The story concludes with the great collapse of traditional talent management in the eighties. Though the story is US-focused, international vignettes are thrown in occasionally.</p>
<p>What is really interesting about the way the story is told, is the careful inter-twining of the  natural logic of a maturing organizational function and the realities of the backdrop of world history. We get quick but comprehensive treatments of the impact of the great depression, World War II, deregulation and outsourcing. There is also a layer of abstraction, where we learn how the long-term cyclical dynamics of the economy drove talent management practices back and forth on various critical issues, such as inside-vs.-outside hiring, centralization vs. decentralization and functional vs. generalist training. And that only scratches the surface &#8212; there are a dozen cyclical and monotonic trends in this story.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t a story told for the sake of story-telling. It is a story told to frame the problem a particular way. The framing is this: traditional models of talent management are based on assumptions of long-term market predictability and capacity planning. Yes, we all recognize that these conditions no longer hold, but what Cappelli really manages to underline is that we need to unlearn and relearn the assumptions as encoded in operating practices. It is not sufficient to unlearn and relearn as individuals, which we&#8217;ve all already done (okay, the ones among us who actually bother to think). An example that really highlights this is AT&amp;T &#8212; decades after the antitrust legislation broke Ma Bell apart, the talent management function still operated the same way, because nobody had bothered to tease apart fundamentally true assumptions from situational ones.</p>
<p>From Part II, I&#8217;ll pick out only one highlight, but it is an important one. Cappelli notes that talent management models basically fell from a peak of sophistication in the 60s to &#8220;nothing&#8221; today (or worse, a 60s hangover that is worse than nothing). He correctly notes that you don&#8217;t have to really solve the whole issue at once. You just have to do &#8220;better than nothing&#8221; to show marked improvements. An example of this is his pointer that simply changing capacity planning to recognize the asymmetric relative costs of undershooting versus overshooting demand (i.e. hiring too many versus too few) will result in significant improvement. Currently, he recommends attempting to undershoot, due to the lower cost of buy vs. build. This is a simple shift from point thinking to &#8220;weighted spread&#8221; thinking, and he is right. All you need is a few such roughly correct moves in the right direction. You don&#8217;t need a huge overhaul that attempts to fix the whole problem at once.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Part I, like I said, is basically a history, and it is  impossible to summarize, since it is extraordinarily dense (though a crisp and easy read).  Part II has 4 chapters that together constitute what Cappelli calls an &#8220;On-Demand&#8221; model, which is based largely on stochastic supply-chain thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chapter 4</strong> covers the make-versus-buy decision (internal development versus external hiring) and concludes with the succinct and intelligent first-step recommendation I mentioned: move from point thinking to weighted spread thinking. For example, supposes it is cheaper to hire than to develop talent internally, and you need a 100 programmers. Let&#8217;s say hiring, retention and development uncertainties lead you to believe that your system will produce between 80 to 120 programmers. Cappelli&#8217;s model would suggest actually targeting an undershooting policy (i.e. set your system up to produce 90 programmers). This is similar in principle to the sort of reasoning that leads airlines to overbook &#8212; it is more expensive to fly an empty seat than to bump a passenger. But don&#8217;t mistake this model for pure left-brained thinking: issues of cultural resistance to outsider experienced hires and such are smartly treated.</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 5</strong> covers demand uncertainty management. This is basically the problem of not knowing clearly how much of what kind of talent you will need, and when. Again Cappelli zooms in on a roughly-right first-step recommendation: portfolio methods. This really only applies to larger, functionally diversified enterprises and works like this: you set in motion a plan to develop a mix of generalist and specialist-functional talent in all your organizations. You then proceed on the assumption that each of your organizations will either undershoot, overshoot or get it right, and be faced with the respective consequences. You hope enough get it right to make the whole portfolio pay off, and also mitigate the situation by moving your generalist talent around. This of course, requires a certain amount of dual career-track management, where centralized corporate control is strong enough to fight silos for influence, and can actually move people around based on corporate rather than local needs, and resist local urges to hide valuable talent.</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 6</strong> is all about ROI and is a dense but not very original coverage of everything you can do, ranging from tuition assistance programs to employee-contributions. It has one serious weakness though &#8212; while it recognizes that companies that invest in developing an employee may not reap the benefits due to poaching, it does not suggest an actively-managed poaching strategy as a way to offset retention failures. This may have a moral reason behind it &#8212; Cappelli notes in the history section that at one time corporations viewed poaching as unethical. This is actually still true in some ways, since rampant poaching hollows out development investment in the economy at large, leading to a tragedy of the commons (Cappelli alludes to this, but we don&#8217;t get the full prisoner&#8217;s dilemma treatment). But still, big corporations subsidizing the talent development costs of little ones is what creates vibrant entrepreneurial cultures like the Bay Area (recall the famous &#8220;Sons of eBay&#8221; phenomenon). Whatever the morality, the optimal amount of poaching in the economy is not zero poaching, and ROI models need to factor in an active poaching strategy. At least <em>some</em> zero-sum thinking is necessary. You need to poach passive candidates from other companies at least as much as you are being poached on. Contribute to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_soup" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">stone soup</a> with some development though.</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 7</strong> is about internal markets. This is the weakest chapter, especially since it completely ignores the role of technology and the growing phenomenon of semi-permeable boundaries between internal and external talent marketplaces by such game-changers as online marketplaces.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Missing</strong></p>
<p>This is an exceptionally valuable book. It is very dense though &#8212; don&#8217;t attempt to read it at Barnes and Noble; you&#8217;ll need to sit with a copy for at least a couple of weeks worth of evenings and weekends, or maybe 3-4 NY-LA flights, to digest this book. But it is well worth the trouble. It is also not an <em>a la carte</em> dip-in-as-you-need-to reference book. You do need to read it cover-to-cover to get the value.</p>
<p>Still, it stops short of being <em>the</em> bible of modern talent management because it doesn&#8217;t cover six things that cannot, in my opinion, be omitted:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strengths Movement: </strong>It mostly ignores/pays lip-service to the &#8220;people are unique&#8221; aspect of talent management. The enormously disruptive effect the (otherwise very valuable)  <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/15/the-coming-triumph-of-the-strengths-movement/">strengths movement</a> has on goal-oriented resource planning needs a better treatment. The fundamental conflict between letting your reports develop their best strengths and actually finishing projects with high sunk costs, needs to be addressed. Strengths-thinking fundamentally shifts the fungible-unique trade-off curve towards &#8220;unique,&#8221; and to that extent, paradigms based on &#8220;fungible&#8221; (such as this one, based on supply chains) are weakened.</li>
<li> <strong>Tension with Strategic Pull:</strong> Almost all the classic big-picture management literature is based on strategic pull. Possibly the only exception is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0066620996?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0066620996" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">Good to Great</a><img style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0066620996" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, which proposes the talent-push based <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/06/22/theory-w-theory-x-and-theory-y/">Bus theory</a> (get the right people on, wrong people off, and then decide where to go). But this is not a trivial issue. IBM, in navigating its big move into services, laid off 250,000 people and hired 100,000. This is an extraordinarily painful way to manage talent in times of big strategic moves. But perhaps this is an impossible problem, if you think of big strategic moves as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400063515?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1400063515" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">The Black Swan</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1400063515" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> events.</li>
<li><strong>Not really on-demand:</strong> The book doesn&#8217;t deserve its title, but the idea that talent management should be on-demand is on the money. On-demand to me suggests metaphors of cloud computing and utility-based computing. If you&#8217;ve ever used Amazon AWS (my team just learned how to use the thing), you know the awesome power of being able to ramp your server fleet up or down very rapidly. That&#8217;s true &#8220;on-demand.&#8221; The labor marketplace <em>is</em> evolving towards that, but the book doesn&#8217;t cover this. In particular, the big trend is the building-out of a crowdsourcing infrastructure in the open economy, beyond contractors, consultants and outsourced facilities. I am talking, of course, about online marketplaces like <a href="http://www.elance.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.elance.com');">elance</a>, <a href="http://www.odesk.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.odesk.com');">odesk</a>, <a href="http://www.logoworks.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.logoworks.com');">logoworks</a>, <a href="http://www.tutorvista.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.tutorvista.com');">tutorvista</a>, <a href="http://www.liveops.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.liveops.com');">liveops</a> and <a href="http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.mturk.com');">Amazon mechanical turk</a>, which truly represent an on-demand global workforce. This megatrend needs to be comprehensively treated for a book with &#8220;on-demand&#8221; in its title &#8212; it&#8217;s ecosystem management, not just hiring, development and retention. But maybe it is too early. Or maybe Jeff Howe&#8217;s upcoming <a href="http://crowdsourcing.typepad.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/crowdsourcing.typepad.com');">Crowdsourcing</a> will do the trick.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual/Home Office and Free Agent Culture: </strong>Another big omission is a treatment of the big movement towards towards sophisticated work-life blending and home/mobile/virtual offices. This clearly has huge implications for the talent management function, and the ideas first developed in Dan Pink&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446678791?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0446678791" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself</a><img style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0446678791" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> need to be included in any theory of talent management.</li>
<li><strong>The 1:1 Talent Acquisition Market and Social Media: </strong>The book&#8217;s treatment of online resumes is decidedly dated, and is completely blind to the big development &#8212; the replacement of the traditional resume (even the always-on Website or Monster resume) by sites like LinkedIn, where all employees &#8212; happy or passively/actively hunting &#8212; maintain a dynamic (rather than static) online presence.</li>
<li><strong>Generational Dynamics: </strong>The book, while covering every other major thread in history, drops the ball on <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/05/generation-blend-by-rob-salkowitz/">generational differences in attitudes towards work</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, one cannot cover anything when treating such a complex issue, but still, a single big-picture, citation-dense closing chapter would have made the book much more complete.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Let’s say you go on a business trip to the city where your favorite cousin lives, who you haven’t seen for a decade. You enjoy a nice dinner together one evening. In utility terms, this is positive work-life chemistry – your company doesn&#8217;t pay anything extra, and you essentially got a freebie family visit. Or maybe you&#8217;ve been meaning to read a book, but haven&#8217;t been able to find the time.  Then the book suddenly becomes critically relevant to your work, and your boss demands that you read and present a summary at the next team meeting. So you spend a few afternoons at your desk, at work, reading it. Work-life chemistry happens when episodes of work-life blending lead to a non-zero sum outcomes. I made up a way to measure and visualize your work-life chemistry. Here is what it looks like. If the arrow in the diagram below is in the reddish zone, as in this example, you are blending work and life positively. In the blue zone, work-life chemistry is draining you (thinking &#8220;dampening&#8221; if you like). Let me explain how this works, and show you how to sketch out your diagram and arrow.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/chem1.png" alt="chem1.png" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span id="more-295"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Chemistry Metaphor</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have been <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/06/03/context-switching-metaphors-for-work-life-blending/">thinking about the phrase <em>work-life blending</em></a> for nearly six years now, and I am surprised I didn’t think of this obvious, chemical extension to the metaphor before. When you blend stuff together, things either react or don’t react. If they react, energy is either sucked up or released (remember <a href="http://chemistry.about.com/cs/generalchemistry/a/aa051903a.htm" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/chemistry.about.com');"><em>endothermic</em> and <em>exothermic</em></a> from high-school chemistry?).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let&#8217;s say you like cooking and eating leisurely dinners. If you bring your work home one evening to meet a deadline, and eat a hurried frozen meal, you had an endothermic, value-draining blending episode. The meet-your-cousin story is an exothermic, value-creating  one (aside, if you Google exothermic and endothermic, you&#8217;ll find cool videos of pretty neat examples. In some cases, endothermic reactions cause the mixture to freeze up!).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, while you probably know, via a simple gut-check whether your typical pattern of work-life blending is energy-draining or energizing, it is interesting to conceptualize it a little more clearly. For reasons you don&#8217;t need to worry about, this method only works for people who are actually reasonably <em>engaged</em> (say 90% plus) with both their work and life, and are trying their best. If you&#8217;ve quit on one or both fronts and are just going through the motions, the method won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here&#8217;s how you do it, in 2 steps. This is more complicated than I would have liked, but I couldn&#8217;t find a way to simplify it further without making the exercise completely trivial/vacuous.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Step 1: Map Your Blending Episodes</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/chem2.png" alt="chem2.png" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Work-life blenders have <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/06/03/context-switching-metaphors-for-work-life-blending/">complicated, highly-variable life activity patterns</a>. So you have to work with individual well-defined episodes (like &#8217;sitting in a coffeeshop on Thursday afternoon&#8217; or &#8216;business trip&#8217;). For every episode, represented by a dot, start with whether it was work or life that was dominant, and imagine the episode in pure form (either the black or red square).  So for a business trip where you met your cousin, imagine the hypothetical one where you didn&#8217;t. Next, ask yourself if the blending made the whole thing better or worse.  Depending on <em>how</em> much the blending improved/worsened the episode, pick either one of the bulging-out curves in the orange zone or one of the concave ones in the blue zone. The dividing line is the dotted-quadrant line.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, slide your dot from its starting point, and along the curve, until you feel it represents the overall work+life value you derived. In some cases, obviously both work and life will increase (bulging-out curves, nearer the squares) &#8212; a win-win. In other cases, one will increase at the expense of the other, with an overall loss or gain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the picture above, the red dot represents a life experience contaminated by some work you&#8217;d rather not have done, and where you gave up more life-value than you gained in work-value. Your total value is of course the distance of the dot from the bottom-left corner. The black dot represents a case where you added some life to a work-episode, with overall increase in value.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Step 2: The Arrow</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, plot a lot of such dots. Maybe for a whole week (the more data-driven among you will want to actually use <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/makeyourown.pdf" title="a printed version">a printed version</a> of this visualization to maintain a real log for a week or more). Once you have a lot of dots, you simply draw an arrow from the bottom-left corner to  the rough center of your spread of dots. Of course, you can make things fancier by making bigger dots for longer time durations or something:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/chem3.png" alt="chem3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Endnote for Techies Only<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This bit only for those who want to (and can) understand the pidgin mathematical reasoning behind this diagramming approach.</p>
<p>You may be inclined to read Pareto optimality notions here, but no, this diagram is not constructed with indifference curves, except for the one circular arc separating blue and orange zone. You <em>do</em> care where you land as you slide along your curve.  The curves do represent constrained spaces for the set of possible worlds representing the ways an individual episode <em>could</em> have happened. Whether your <em>actual</em> world was optimal or not depends, of course, on additional constraints that forced the episode to play out a particular way (you <em>had</em> to work from home to wait for the cable guy). Obviously, if you could choose to act out every episode in its best possible world, all dots would line up along the 45 degree line, the two &#8216;pure&#8217; locations, or along the circular quadrant arc.</p>
<p>And if you were wondering why I limited the method to people who were basically engaged in both work and life, here&#8217;s why. It allows you normalize the pure cases to unity (a piece of work done as well as possible; a life-experience as satisfactory as possible). If you were going through the motions at work, or have an unhappy marriage, you couldn&#8217;t plot all &#8220;pure&#8221; possible-world case episodes at the two squares. Stuff would spread out along the axes and get way more messy.</p>
<p>A subtle point.  The watershed indifference curve can either be the straight line between the two squares, or the circular-quadrant arc, depending on whether you are using root-mean-square total value or straight addition. Actually, <em>any</em> of the arcs can be the watershed line if you use an appropriate <em>p-</em>norm (<em>p</em>=infinity gives you a square constraint that I haven&#8217;t shown, but has an interesting interpretation). This subtlety doesn&#8217;t affect the thought experiment at all, as far as I can see, but if you spotted it, you get a cookie.</p>
<p>I actually used this type of modeling on some problems in figuring out the benefits of formation flight for airplanes during my PhD.</p>
<p>This is paper-napkin level thinking obviously, but I suspect it&#8217;ll take only a little refinement to turn it into a cute little computer program that does the plotting in a systematic way taking episode-level input data. But for me, the thought experiment is interesting enough. I don&#8217;t see how you could actually measure the variables involved in meaningful and sufficiently noiseless ways, but if you can figure out a way to turn this into a real model, I am all ears!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For history buffs like me, a rich understanding of the temporal structure of the world is very important, almost more so than its <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/07/17/visualizing-the-2d-world-with-cartograms/">spatial structure</a>. Timelines to me are in some ways vastly more interesting than atlases and maps. More generally, I (like I suspect, many others), have been watching jealously while creative programmers have been making up great &#8220;2.0&#8243; style visualizations, and wishing I could use their tools. Today, a startup named <a href="http://www.dipity.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.dipity.com');">Dipity</a> made my day by creating a fantastic time-line visualization tool, which I used to create this visualization of the history of my employer, Xerox. I absolutely love it when a company does just one thing, but does it really well. <a href="http://www.wikinomics.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.wikinomics.com');">Wikinomics.com</a> has a <a href="http://www.wikinomics.com/blog/index.php/2008/07/07/interview-with-dipity-ceo-and-co-founder-derek-dukes/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.wikinomics.com');">great interview with the co-founder, Derek Dukes</a>. I hope this is the start of a whole new ecosystem of startups that creates a riot of visualization tools for everybody to use. Next request: somebody create a tool for user-generated cartograms please.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I took my usual mile-long walk to my neighborhood Starbucks, in suburban Rochester, something I often do when I need a physical rhythm to help tame runaway thoughts. I sat on the patio, sipping my drink, watching the sun set behind <a href="http://www.billgrays.com/history.htm" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.billgrays.com');">Bill Gray&#8217;s</a> restaurant. Cars and Harley Davidsons (upstate New York is biker country) occasionally rumbled by. At some point, the scene quietly turned magical and surreal. The buzz of the other coffee drinkers&#8217; conversations faded.  The sunset acquired a sudden stillness. I took a picture with my cellphone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/hardroad.jpg" alt="Hard Road" /></p>
<p><span id="more-289"></span> Somehow, my mind leaped to one of my favorite paintings, Edward Hopper&#8217;s famous <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">Nighthawks</a> </em>(no, I am not particularly eclectic when it comes to art).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nighthawks.jpg" alt="Nighthawks" height="210" width="385" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>(picture from Wikimedia; fair use) </em></p>
<p>I understood why the Bill-Gray moment had arrested me. The scene before my eyes, like <em>Nighthawks </em>(only more so)<em>, </em>captured the quintessence of America; its hard-edged romance, its sadness, its big-skied, heart-wrenching beauty, and its lonely search for community.</p>
<p>My thoughts wandered to a little vignette in Curtis White&#8217;s entertaining screed, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060730595?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060730595" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">The Middle Mind</a> (which introduced me to <em>Nighthawks)</em>, which<em> </em> describes a visit to a hospital by the author and a friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apropos of nothing he said, pointing to a length of clear plastic tubing suspended above us, &#8220;That amber light is beautiful.&#8221; And there, in fact, was a tiny amber light in the middle of the tubing, a little light I hadn&#8217;t noticed at all. It was bright like an isolated star. It triangulated us. Suddenly, the situation changed for me into something completely other than it had been the moment before. We&#8217;d been translated. Reordered. Nicolas&#8217; comment reconstellated us. I had a powerful feeling that everything had just been changed utterly and been made &#8212; what other word was there for it? &#8212; <em>beautiful</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>What happened next, I suspect, gets to the heart of the writing-blogging instinct. As the raw material &#8212; <em>scene, Nighthawks, episode from Middle Mind &#8212; </em>simmered in my unstable attention, an urge emerged to do something with my mental reaction. I grew restless.  The scene no longer held me in thrall, I needed to write. A <a href="http://xkcd.com/77/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/xkcd.com');">recent xkcd comic</a> captured this dynamic brilliantly:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/bored_with_the_internet.jpg" target="_blank" title="xkcd"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/bored_with_the_internet.thumbnail.jpg" alt="xkcd" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><em>(click to read, new window will open; Creative Commons)</em></p>
<p>If you think about it, this is a tragic thing. I imagine that the non-writer-mind is able to experience life in unadulterated ways for much longer periods (or <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/08/13/the-parrot/">maybe not</a>). The writer-mind can never see the world as it is for very long.  Curtains of words close off experiences as rapidly as the world generates them (other creative urges weave other sorts of curtains I suppose).</p>
<p>I never attempt to meditate, still my mind, or otherwise resist the urge. But there are consolations to succumbing. I read a lot, observe greedily , toss concepts around, analyze, make and break connections, synthesize, invent metaphors, and make a sport out of grabbing passing phrases and visualizations. The play is entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Cutting the Cake</strong></p>
<p>I launched Ribbonfarm exactly a year ago, on July 4th, 2007. During the year, I wrote 139,519 words, or the equivalent of a 400-page trade paperback. For comparison, Balzac and Victor Hugo, among the most prolific of writers, <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Prolific-Writers&amp;id=29771" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/ezinearticles.com');">reportedly churned out a million words a year</a>. So my output isn&#8217;t too shabby. That was 99 articles (almost all original) averaging about 1409 words each, with over 93% of the articles being 300 words or more. And this while working only 2-3 evenings a week. I don&#8217;t doubt my urges anymore: good or bad, I am a writer. I don&#8217;t blog to make money, cultivate relationships, market consulting services or dominate a niche with my personal brand (though those are all nice things to have happen). I blog to write.</p>
<p>Since this blog still runs (for somebody living in America) at kid-lemonade-stand levels of cash flow, I thought I&#8217;d share the gory details.</p>
<ul>
<li> I made $81.1 in organic revenue, from Google AdSense, Amazon.com referrals and PayPal donations (that classy-panhandling &#8216;buy-me-a-cappuccino&#8217; link).</li>
<li>I made $243 in what you might call <em>inorganic</em> revenue &#8212; prize money (the odd figure is because the prize was in Indian rupees, not dollars). I add that to the &#8216;blog income&#8217; because I wrote the <a href="http://vgr.sulekha.com/blog/post/2007/09/writing-english-while-brown.htm" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/vgr.sulekha.com');">prize-winning article</a> on another blog, mainly to promote this blog, and ended up winning, by accident, a contest where I&#8217;d been automatically entered.</li>
<li>I made $178.06 through in-kind income &#8212; review copies of books.</li>
<li>Costs: $119.1 in hosting charges, $246 for experimentation with hired help ($103 for an artist, $143 for marketer)</li>
<li>I also paid a different artist $200 to help me illustrate my comic-book story, <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/01/22/mousetrap-20-a-comicbook/">Mousetrap 2.0</a>. This was a dual-use project, since I also submitted that piece as a contribution to a book, but let&#8217;s bill the spend to the blog.</li>
<li>I could not possibly view the time I spent writing and thinking as a cost, so I add $0 for that, but if you must know, I&#8217;d estimate I spent about  500 hours on this blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in dollar terms &#8212; money actually spent and made, I made $502 and spent $565, a loss of  $63, or 11%. If I assume that the operating loss can be viewed entirely as audience acquisition costs (i.e. an investment), it works out to about $0.63 per RSS feed subscriber (my peak subscriber count during the year was 99, according to feedburner).</p>
<p>My 99 posts generated 315 comments by 119 people (92 by me). There were 5 people with 5 or more comments each (tubelite, kapsio, gregory, viraje, saurabh), and 32 people with 2 or more comments. The silent majority grew steadily, from about 566 visitors in July 2007 to 3024 visitors in June 2008. Other indicators stayed healthy.</p>
<p>Thank you, guys.</p>
<p>Qualitatively too, it was a good first year. I made the <a href="http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/27/fridays-link-the-illustrated-work-life/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com');">New York Times</a>. I wrote <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/best-of-ribbonfarm/">some pretty good pieces</a> by my own reckoning. I made progress on my book-length projects. I made some new friends. I learned a lot about writing that I did not know before.</p>
<p><strong>A Dedication for Year 2: Wilbur<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wilbur.jpg" alt="Wilbur" height="177" width="221" /></p>
<p>We adopted Wilbur in February, at 7 months. This picture has been the background for my cellphone since. On the hour-long drive home from the pet foster home, my wife and I couldn&#8217;t agree on a name, so he remained Wilbur. When he got home, he immediately took over the apartment from our older, but timid and nervous-tempered cat, Jackson. He ran all over, he jumped up on our shoulders, he chased furiously after a laser pointer.</p>
<p>Four months later, Wilbur grew tired and began wasting away. We went from vet to vet, but it was no use. Wilbur, most likely, had <a href="http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures/fip.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.vet.cornell.edu');">feline infectious peritonitis, or FIP</a>, which is fatal. He developed severe diarrhea, stopped eating, and grew anemic and jaundiced. A nerve complication made him stumble like a drunk when he tried, weakly, to walk, and twitch violently when touched. Within four weeks, by the end of June, he had become skin draped over bones, the long fur on his hind legs matted with feces that we could not clean. Eyes glazed over with what I imagine was dull pain looked unseeingly at me when I looked at him. Finally on June 28, I watched, blinded by tears, as the vet euthanized him. He died so quietly, it was almost as if he had been waiting for it. I sat with his body and cried for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The entire week before and after, I experienced, for the first time, the surreal world that surrounds the death of a loved one, and the special grief that accompanies the death of the young. So long as I was absorbed in something else, I was normal and functional. The moment I saw him or thought of him, I was blinded and frozen by grief. My wife, veteran of many pets, dealt with it much better, though she could not bear to be present at the final moment. I stayed, held there both by an unwillingness to let go, and that selfish instinct which drives me to experience everything that might possibly enrich and deepen my thinking and writing. I cannot feel ashamed of that. Yes, partly I stayed with Wilbur, and chose to experience the intense grief of watching his final moments, so I could become a deeper writer.</p>
<p>Ribbonfarm is a year old. Wilbur died just short of his first year. So I will dedicate Year 2 of ribbonfarm to Wilbur, the little cat who liked to be held over my shoulder, from where he curiously watched the world behind me. I hope I can bring to my writing something even a hundredth as pure as Wilbur&#8217;s perception of the world from my shoulder.</p>
<p>Thank you all for reading.

The picture is also a nice start to some ideas I hope to post on the idea of the entire world of technology+people as a single giant computer. There is a lot of excitement around Matrix/Terminator-like Skynet visions at the moment. IEEE Spectrum, just ran a cover feature on the notion of the singularity, or as they aptly called it, <a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun08/6311" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.spectrum.ieee.org');">&#8220;The Rapture of the Geeks&#8221;</a>, and Kevin Kelly of Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/special_multimedia/2008/st_infoporn_1607" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.wired.com');">joined in</a> with thoughts on the global computer becoming more complex than a human brain, with peer Chris Anderson <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2008/06/where-to-run-th.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.longtail.com');">weighing in</a> with some commentary. We should all credit Nick Carr with starting this round in this interesting conversation with the <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/02/23/the-big-switch-by-nicholas-carr/">Big Switch</a>, and also his related recent piece in the <em>Atlantic</em>, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.theatlantic.com');">Is Google Making us Stupid?</a>  (though of course, it goes back decades). The Ray Kurzweil devotees over at the Singularity Institute have been really going at this topic on their blog, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.overcomingbias.com');">Overcoming Bias</a>.<br />
I did my bit of zeitgeist-spotting, as you may recall, with my <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/01/22/mousetrap-20-a-comicbook/">Mousetrap 2.0 comicbook</a>. I have a major writing project in the works on these themes.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For real estate agents, it is <em>location, location, location.</em> For businesses, it is <em>talent, talent, talent.</em>  Neither of Douglas McGregor&#8217;s classic pair, <a href="http://www.accel-team.com/human_relations/hrels_03_mcgregor.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.accel-team.com');">Theory X and Theory Y</a>, works anymore, and neither does any clever combination thereof.

Kicking and screaming, anybody with half a brain has accepted that the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">fungible</a> headcount&#8221; mental model must necessarily be replaced with  a &#8220;people are unique&#8221; mental model. But this uplifting let&#8217;s-all-self-actualize <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/15/the-coming-triumph-of-the-strengths-movement/">strengths message</a> has brought with it the demanding task of mass-customized management, all in the face of revolving-door dynamics. In this series, I offer up the outlines of a new beta theory, Theory W, that I hope will help, and which you&#8217;ll have to help me finish.</p>
<p><span id="more-286"></span></p>
<p><strong>Theory W</strong></p>
<p>Theory W is a nice name for the theory of talent management I am starting to make up. It follows the same algebraic-unknown nomenclature scheme of Theory X and Theory Y that suggests that we&#8217;ll never <em>really</em> know the whole answer. It also suggests, by being a precursor to X and Y in the alphabet, that we are talking about a theory that is more fundamental. Finally, W is a nice letter that could stand for &#8220;Wikinomics,&#8221; &#8220;We,&#8221; &#8220;Work,&#8221; or &#8220;World,&#8221; all of which are fine connotations for the theory I am about to describe.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll describe it in detail in the next post (remember to subscribe to the RSS feed to get alerted). In this post, I&#8217;ll talk about why existing models of talent management have been undermined to the point that they are completely unworkable today. Besides X and Y, there are no less than <em>nine</em> schools of thought that I&#8217;ve been able to find, in researching this topic, which together probably account for 80% of the managerial behavior out there. These theories drive actions in all aspects of talent management - acquisition, retention, turnover-management and development, and apply to managing people down, up or sideways, within corporate walls or &#8220;outside&#8221; in your ecosystem.</p>
<p>None of them work today, but it is important to start by understanding them.</p>
<p><strong>The Nine Undermined Models of Talent Management</strong></p>
<p>There is a reason why I didn&#8217;t call this list the nine <em>myths</em> of talent management. Each of these theories has a real germ of truth within it, that makes it at least slightly true under all conditions. Each also has a sweet spot that makes it <em>strongly</em> true under restricted conditions.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why there is a crisis in talent management &#8212; today&#8217;s conditions are not a sweet spot for any extant theory, and their limited &#8216;always true&#8217; elements are not sufficient to navigate by.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_theory_Y" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">1. Theory X</a>: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><u>High concept</u>: &#8220;people hate work, and if they can slack off, they will.&#8221; This theory arises from classical Western tragic/conservative philosophy which views humans as fundamentally flawed. It was <em>practically</em> true for a long time, even if not psychologically true. It is only recently in history that enough non-crappy work has been created that significant numbers can (and therefore do) aspire to it.</li>
<li><u>Why it is being been undermined</u>: no, managers haven&#8217;t figured out how to make everybody love work, or make all work lovable, but theory X cannot even continue on life support anymore. The new economy enables and incentivizes a much more rapid and hopeless grass-is-greener wanderlust among employees. Operate by Theory X and people will simply leave in the forlorn hope of finding something better. An economy consisting of a flow of unhappy people trudging through revolving doors is only slightly better for all than one where they stay put in quiet desperation, and worse for the X-firms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_theory_Y" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">2. Theory Y</a>: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><u>High concept</u>: &#8220;people love work, and self-actualize through it; help them build on their strengths and grow.&#8221; This theory descends from Maslow and is today represented by the <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/15/the-coming-triumph-of-the-strengths-movement/">strengths movement</a>.</li>
<li><u>Why it is being undermined</u>: it does not tell you how to decide <em>if </em>it is possible at all to align the optimal growth directions of an individual and an organization (or two individuals in the free-agent economy), and <em>how</em> to do so when it is possible. In its more dangerous manifestations, Theory Y sticks its head in the sand and asserts that alignment is <em>always</em> possible. It is more a <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/05/generation-blend-by-rob-salkowitz/">reflection of wishful-thinking Boomer ideology</a> than reality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_Z" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">3. Theory Z</a>: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><u>High concept:</u> &#8220;the Nanny Corporation.&#8221; This theory, which attempted to capture the differentiating elements of Japanese life-time employment models with respect to X and Y, operates on the idea that corporations  can use their vast resources to sufficiently satisfy individual non-work aspirations to stem attrition. If this seems laughably paternalistic/maternalistic or Asian-only, check out the recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401303706?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1401303706" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">The Dream Manager</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1401303706" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />, which suggests via an American parable, the creation of a Chief Dream Manager position to help employees reach for their dreams. Or think of the famous Google Buffet.</li>
<li><u>Why it is being undermined:</u>  Theory Z, besides making anybody with the slightest individualistic spark (such as us Gen X&#8217;ers) throw up, vastly overestimates what corporations can realistically provide by way of incentive structures. It is presumptuous to think corporations can actually help employees enough with their dreams to solve the talent problem. I am not saying corporations can&#8217;t help at all, but they cannot help <em>enough.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.joelonsoftware.com');"><strong>4. The Only-the-Best Theory</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><u>High concept</u>: &#8220;Good people working with a bad process will beat bad people working with a good process every time.&#8221;  I recently had a chance to ask a (<em>very very)</em> famous manager, now retired, about how he achieved his phenomenal successes, and was disappointed to get the &#8216;hire-only-the-best&#8217; theory. The philosophy is driven by the somewhat arrogant &#8220;try to hire people smarter than yourself&#8221; heuristic.</li>
<li><u>Why it is being undermined</u>: The theory actually isn&#8217;t subtle at all, and the most obvious problem kills it &#8212; at any given time, only a tiny percentage of people/companies will have the &#8220;It&#8221; factor, or the burnable money to attract the best and pursue an &#8220;only the best&#8221; strategy. What are the rest supposed to do? Eat cake? There are also more basic problems around <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/steve-yegge.blogspot.com');">recognizing people smarter than yourself</a>. If you cannot get good work out of less-than-genius level people, you will never get started, and the economy wouldn&#8217;t function.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><u>High concept:</u> &#8220;Get the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and then decide where to go.&#8221; This theory, related to &#8216;Only the  best,&#8217; has its roots in the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060522003?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060522003" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">the classic work on teams </a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060522003" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> by Katzenbach, as well as the ideas in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0066620996?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0066620996" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">Good to Great</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0066620996" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />. Of all the theories in this list, this is probably the most sophisticated one today, and acknowledges the conflict between pre-defined goals and talent.</li>
<li><u>Why it is being undermined:</u> Three reasons. First, it is only in rare windows of opportunity that you have the luxury of choosing objectives to suit a team. In most real situations, you have to work towards existing high-sunk-cost goals of greater or lesser  definition.  Second, the high-performing, high-chemistry team of people with beautifully-matched strengths is much too rare to drive the bulk of everyday work. Third: every successful effort eventually needs to scale, and the more people you need, the less picky you can be about fit and chemistry.</li>
</ul>

The Radical Individualism Theory</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><u>High concept:</u> &#8220;The firm is dead; everybody go solo.&#8221; This is a highly seductive theory, and I was enamored of it for quite a while.  Historically, employment by large, organized firms is something of an anomaly. Freelance labor was gradually displaced by wage labor between the 1870s and the 1980s, after which, in a startling reversal <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446678791?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0446678791" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">chronicled by Dan Pink</a>, it started making a comeback. Reading <em>&#8220;should</em> happen&#8221; into limited &#8220;<em>is happening</em>&#8221; data is supported by ideas from <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/23/ronald-coase-and-salvation-from-anthropological-economics/">Coase economics</a>, that suggests that lowered economic transaction costs should cause the firm to shrink. Taken to its absurd limit, you might imagine that the talent problem simply goes away if everybody is a free agent in a frictionless Darwinian economy.</li>
<li><u>Why it is being undermined:</u> Even if everybody had entrepreneurial strengths, outside a very narrow range of largely self-contained economic roles (such as writers and artists), free agents are no more free from the talent wars than firms.  You still need to enmesh yourself in a community of talent to be the best you can be, whether or not that community is a formal firm. Worse, while there are fundamental economic forces creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">long tail</a> labor market of free agents, other forces are making large firms stronger than ever, perhaps presaging an age of mega-firms. That&#8217;s a story for another day. Worst of all, this theory sometimes shows up in the form of a specious fire-your-boss models, vacuous personal-brand models, or immoral pyramid schemes (such as the model in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307353133?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307353133" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">The 4-Hour Workweek)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307353133" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />.</li>

<p><a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/06/15/facebook_really.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/paul.kedrosky.com');"><strong>Seven: The Kool-Aid Theory</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><u>High-concept:</u> &#8220;Create a bandwagon everybody wants to ride on.&#8221; The most graphic demonstration I&#8217;ve seen of this is a <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/06/15/facebook_really.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/paul.kedrosky.com');">famous goodbye email from Justin Rosenstein</a>, who left Google for Facebook (&#8221;Facebook really is That company&#8230;I&#8217;m serious. I have drunk from the kool-aid, and it is delicious.&#8221;).</li>
<li><u>Why it is being undermined:</u> Besides the obvious problem that there can&#8217;t be too many &#8220;It&#8221; companies at any given time, Kool-aid Talent Economics is bad for companies and individuals and worse for the global economy. Kool-Aid companies suffer from the Sons-of-eBay effect, where high-growth and a young and exciting culture attracts too many smart but naive people who eventually spin-off as entrepreneurs due to the frustrations of a strengths-unbalanced pipeline. You don&#8217;t hear about it until growth slows and the &#8220;It&#8221; company needs to control costs like everybody else and manage people more effectively. Non Kool-Aid companies with fantastic opportunities to offer suffer from artificial scarcity. The economy as a whole suffers because of suboptimal use of talent, and individuals suffer as they learn the perils of band-wagonism the hard way. &#8220;Be like Google&#8221; is not a theory. It is wishful thinking.</li>

<ul>
<li><u>High-concept:</u> &#8220;If you can&#8217;t attract talent you aren&#8217;t fit to.&#8221; This is a line of reasoning that supports doing nothing. It suggests taking the broad view that the Darwinian logic of the marketplace will allocate labor resources efficiently.</li>
<li><u>Why it is being undermined:</u> Increasingly, we all recognize that the globalized world marketplace is <em>not </em>a pure Darwinian struggle. <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/05/18/megacommunities-and-macrotrends/">Enough common issues now bind our destinies</a> &#8212; ranging from global warming and terror to scarce oil and AIDS, that we have to figure out how to get beyond this impossible-problem framing. If we don&#8217;t we are all doomed.</li>

<ul>
<li><u>High-concept:</u> &#8220;It&#8217;s called WORK for a reason.&#8221; You&#8217;d think the prison-warden school of management was shut down long ago, but every once in a while, somebody will resurrect the theory of talent management that is simple, elegant and wrong &#8212; put enough scary punishments in place to get minimal performance out of anybody, reward those who manage to exceed expectations amidst the misery. There is a homey <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=git+r+done" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.urbandictionary.com');">git &#8216;r done</a> feel of cutting the bullshit to this philosophy that appeals to many. In subtler forms, you get over-simplistic management-by-parable models like the One-Minute Manager.</li>
<li><u>Why it is being undermined:</u> This model hasn&#8217;t had any credibility since the mid nineteenth century. It&#8217;s the twenty-first century. The nature of organized work has been evolving for several centuries. If you really want to delude yourself that talent management, especially with information workers, is this simple, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be in the talent management business.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&#8217;s it for the roundup of existing theories. Next time, we&#8217;ll talk about Theory W. Expect that post when you see it &#8212; I&#8217;ll try to get it out in the next couple of weeks.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">ABDs agonize far too much about finishing, and not enough about      finishing right. A successful Ph.D. experience, as opposed to a merely completed      one, is one that leaves you with self-assurance, confidence in your own abilities,      and full of the creativity and energy required to go after more ambitious      pursuits. A <em>completed</em> but <em>unsuccessful</em> Ph.D. experience, on      the other hand, can leave you cynical, broken, and effectively ruined for      further research work. Many, of course, acquire &#8220;successful&#8221; mindsets      via postdoctoral experiences, but you should aim to get it right the first      time.<br />
I have a magic formula for a successful Ph.D. Through the course of your doctoral      work, you must make at least 3 significant leap-of-faith decisions, that turn      out to be right. Here is a picture of what a leap of faith looks like:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/leapoffaith.jpg" alt="Leap of faith" /></p>
<p align="center"><span id="more-256"></span></p>
<p align="left"><em>(this piece was written for the <a href="http://www.abdsurvivalguide.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.abdsurvivalguide.com');">All But Dissertation Survival Guide (ABDSG)</a> newsletter, which targets PhD students)</em></p>
<p align="left">A leap of faith is a decision that goes against the best-intentioned      advice of your supervisor, committee members, mentors, coaches and peers.      A decision that is poorly supported by evidence or reasoning. A decision that      exposes you to some real risk. In the more courageous instances, it is also      a decision which actually goes <em>against</em> plausible (but not conclusive      - that would be dumb) evidence and reasoning. I&#8217;ll tell you about my top three      in a bit, but first let&#8217;s ask: why do you need leaps of faith? And why three?</p>
<p align="left"> The <em>why</em> is simple. Think about the four most common      ways of justifying a choice or decision:</p>
<p align="left"> 1. &#8220;Because Expert X says so,&#8221;<br />
2. &#8220;Because the numbers say so,&#8221;<br />
3. &#8220;Because A and B imply C,&#8221;<br />
4. &#8220;Because I just feel it is the right choice.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left"> The first three &#8212; people, data and analysis &#8212; are all external      loci of trust. The fourth, intuition, however, is trust in gestalt/subconscious      perceptions and computations that bubble up into conscious awareness as an      inclination to choose (or avoid) a particular option. Call it right-brained      decision-making if you like. You<em> can&#8217;t </em>externalize it except with hindsight.      Intuition isn&#8217;t random guesswork though: it is just thinking you can&#8217;t see.      Trusting your intuition is like trusting a hidden person inside yourself who      gives you oracular answers without much explanation.</p>
<p align="left"> Every leap of faith moves what psychologists call your &#8220;locus      of control&#8221; more inward by teaching you to trust your instincts. Leaps      of faith are also what get you engaged in significant work, and allow you      to let go and be creative without losing the sense of owning your destiny.      Leaps of faith build up your resilience, and you&#8217;ll need plenty of that in      the face of the inevitable setbacks and losses that come with a life in research.</p>
<p align="left"> Now why <em>three</em>? Again the answer is simple. <em>One</em>      successful leap of faith, especially if it is significant, can seem like luck      or even a divinely-ordained moment of enlightenment for the spiritual among      you.<em> Two</em> can be explained away as coincidence. But get to the magic      number <em>three</em>, and suddenly you start to trust yourself in a deep way;      you&#8217;re doing <em>something</em> right in your subterranean thinking. It is a      moment that unleashes enormous reserves of positive energy.</p>
<p align="left"> Of course, if in the process of making three sound leaps, you      make ten cripplingly unsound ones, you are likely to lose all credibility.      So you do need to do all the commonsense things that increase your chances,      like reading widely, talking to many people, practicing your skills, spending      time reflecting, and so forth. Your subconscious computer obeys the garbage-in-garbage-out      rule. If you don&#8217;t feed it enough of the right input, it won&#8217;t suggest inspired      decisions.</p>
<p align="left"> If this sounds more risky than you like, you can work your      way up by making smaller &#8220;practice&#8221; leaps of faith and making increasingly      larger leaps where you seem to have a better &#8220;hit&#8221; rate. (Don&#8217;t      analyze <em>why</em> though, just find the areas where you seem to be lucky.      Is your judgment sounder on mathematical questions than programming questions?      Make bigger leaps of faith there.)</p>
<p align="left"> But eventually baby leaps won&#8217;t do. You need the three significant      ones. And you&#8217;ll know when you make them. There are some disciplined ways      to tease out good intuitive judgments (see, for example, <em>Focusing</em> by      Eugene Gendlin), but the key is to find <em>some</em> way to listen to your      intuition and then learn to trust it, one decision at a time.</p>
<p align="left"> Now let me tell you about my three leaps of faith.</p>
<p align="left"> <strong>Leap of Faith #1: Doing a Romantic Ph.D.</strong></p>
<p align="left"> My first big leap of faith was to commit, at high risk, to      what I call a romantic Ph.D. All around me, I saw wise, skeptical and pragmatic      people who seemed to believe that a Ph.D. was merely an apprenticeship that      would teach me a few specialized skills and get me a passport that would open      certain doors. But I was craving a philosophical growth experience, not a      piece of paper or a passport into a professional elite class.</p>
<p align="left"> Three years into my graduate program, I was depressed, uninterested      in my work and hating every minute of my life. But I had all the trappings      of progress &#8212; I&#8217;d written a couple of journal articles and passed my qualifiers.      My then-supervisor was trying to be encouraging, telling me I was only one      more result away from a defensible Ph.D.</p>
<p align="left"> My leap of faith was deciding to quit this first direction,      despite my heavy investment. It seemed completely irrational at the time.      I gave up my funding, found a different advisor who seemed interested in the      half-baked ideas I wanted to explore, and went off to work at a job for a      year while waiting for <em>his </em>funding to come through.</p>
<p align="left"> I know today that I owe my career and sanity to that decision.      You may not, as I do, view the Ph.D. as the modern day equivalent of a Zen      retreat, with similar expectations, but the point is, I made a leap of faith      towards <em>my</em> expectations. You will need, at some point, to make a leap      of faith towards <em>yours</em>.</p>
<p align="left"> <strong>Leap of Faith #2: Ignoring the &#8220;Simplest Problem&#8221;      Heuristic</strong></p>
<p align="left"> My second big leap of faith was choosing to go against what      amounts to gospel in my field, control theory. Pretty much every professor      I&#8217;d interacted with offered me one piece of high-level advice: write down      and start with the simplest model of the problem you are working on. This      is excellent advice, but I did not trust it, because it always seemed to guide      me away from interesting problems.</p>
<p align="left"> I wanted to study the dynamics of swarms of spacecraft and      aircraft, but the rule-of-thumb, applied blindly, told me to study the simplest      case (two interacting aircraft or spacecraft). After following the &#8220;simplest&#8221;      rule-of-thumb for my first problem, I made a leap of faith and started working      with models of arbitrary numbers of spacecraft. Systems that were much too      complex to analyze with pen-and-paper mathematics and would only yield to      computer models.</p>
<p align="left"> This was uncharted territory for my supervisor and most of      the experienced researchers I interacted with. My indulgent supervisor openly      indicated that in his mind, he was giving me enough rope to hang myself. Yet      this was where interesting things were happening in the field. I struggled,      but eventually I found ways to do very interesting things with my models of      arbitrary numbers of spacecraft.<br />
Again, today, five years down the line, I know I am most appreciated by my      peers for my ability to deal with complexity, and resisting the urge to simplify      too much. My leap of faith bought me my professional identity.</p>
<p align="left"> <strong>Leap of Faith #3: Going Truly Interdisciplinary</strong></p>
<p align="left"> This last one may not seem like much of a leap of faith. Everybody      declares his or her work is interdisciplinary. But <em>true</em> interdisciplinary      work is still the exception, not the rule. Much of what is packaged as interdisciplinary      is just that &#8212; packaging. I&#8217;ll write another time about what &#8220;true&#8221;      means, but from a practical point of view, deciding to &#8220;go interdisciplinary&#8221;      carries significant risks.</p>
<p align="left"> In my case, I ended up putting a significant number of elements      in my work drawn from two fields that are adjacent to control theory &#8212; operations      research and artificial intelligence. I had to learn the sociology, culture,      language and literature of three distinct communities, and build relationships      with people who understood some parts of what I was doing, but had no idea      what the other parts were about. Going interdisciplinary also required learning      to listen to, and respond to, feedback from committee members who were looking      for drastically different (often conflicting) things in my work.</p>
<p align="left"> The leap of faith here was that there was interesting stuff      to be found in the interstices of the three disciplines, even if I could only      fumble with my self-invented methods there, without recourse to the well-honed      methodologies of disciplinary work.</p>
<p align="left"> This decision, too, has turned out to be absolutely critical      to me. The rather unique opportunities that have opened up for me since my      Ph.D. were created by the interdisciplinary elements of my Ph.D.</p>
<p align="left"><strong> Conclusion</strong></p>
<p align="left"> I finished my Ph.D. almost five years ago. Looking back, with      a few years each of postdoctoral and industrial research experience under      my belt, one observation stands out: I learned almost nothing from my mistakes,      but I learned a huge amount every time I did something <em>right</em> that I      didn&#8217;t <em>know</em> at the time was going to turn out to be right. In a very      fundamental way, the leap of faith is the atomic unit of true learning.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a quick review of the 27 articles I posted between March 21 and June 16. I have given up trying to be regular, let alone frequent, with these roundups. And to think, when I started this blog about a year ago, I thought I&#8217;d be doing <em>weekly</em> roundups. Ha ha. So expect these roundups when you see them (at least until I can afford to hire a regular editor, or somebody volunteers)!</p>
<p><span id="more-285"></span></p>
<p>The usual request &#8212; please forward this roundup to people you think would like an introduction to ribbonfarm, and digg, stumble etc. The previous <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/03/21/roundup-jan-17-march-20/">roundup, for January 17 - March 20</a> is here. If you <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/mail/">sign up for the email newsletter</a>, you can get these roundup posts through the email newsletter, a good way to keep up if you aren&#8217;t the RSS or regular-bookmark-checker type.</p>

Let&#8217;s deconstruct the &#8216;hello&#8217; for a minute, before diving into the review.</p>
<p align="center"> <iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1422125009&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Why does this cover work so beautifully for a book about tapping into social media?</p>
<p><span id="more-282"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Cover</strong></p>
<p>Think of the default imagery evoked by  the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/groundswell" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/dictionary.reference.com');">dictionary definitions of  &#8216;groundswell&#8217;</a> &#8212; a deep rolling/swelling of the oceans or a wave of popular sentiment. The first, literal, meaning conjures up a raging, tumultuous oceanscape. The second, a sociological metaphor, suggests an overpowering and disorganized crowd of the Burning Man variety.  The respective associations are tsunami-scale chaos and destruction and anarchic demagoguery-fueled nihilism.</p>
<p>The cover art brilliantly avoids these anxiety-inducing associations, and manages to suggest instead a broad and deep movement of unleashed energy, fueled by a fundamental seismic shift. The simple base graphic of radiating shockwaves from an epicenter gets at the power, while gently de-emphasizing the transient anarchy and violence (and incidentally, suggesting a &#8216;rising above the noise&#8217; of 2.0). The title word, simply and asymmetrically broken into two, by evoking thoughts of undersea fault lines and dissonance, tersely conveys the idea, &#8220;something fundamental has changed, and has created a powerful instability.&#8221; The lime-green color, along with the off-center positioning of the discrete visual elements, leaves figure-ground blending gestalt space at the center of the cover. This perfectly gets at the decentered and cheerfully (rather than grimly-political) ironic  <em>zeitgeist</em> of the 2.0 revolution.</p>
<p>The minor design details are done right as well &#8212; the lower-case title at once suggests a 2.0 design aesthetic, and the <em>vox populi </em>nature of the dynamic.</p>
<p>Five stars on the cover. I hope Harvard Business Press paid Stephani well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, unlike the godawful blue ocean metaphor which provoked <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/08/06/book-review-blue-ocean-strategy/">my one and only polemic</a> on this site, the substance of the metaphor does full justice to the brilliant cover, so let&#8217;s talk about that.</p>
<p><strong>The Book</strong></p>
<p>That atypical detour aside, let&#8217;s do the review &#8212; overview, highlights, quickie chapter-wise summary, and finishing up with some warnings about what is otherwise a very good book.</p>
<p>I am <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/01/24/how-to-pick-business-and-self-improvement-books/">pretty formulaic</a> about how I judge business books in my first pass. Li and Bernoff, both of Forrester research, know their stuff and get the basics right; this is a well-constructed blend of abstraction and anecdote, plug-and-play process suggestions and you-need-to-actually-think advice, data and axiom. The tone is unapologetically didactic. This is an attempt at an instruction manual, not an invitation to conceptual debate. And like any good instruction manual, it isn&#8217;t shy about proposing definitions upfront:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Groundswell</strong>: A social trend in which people use technology to get the things they need from each other rather than traditional institutions like corporations.</p></blockquote>
<p>You could argue with that, but it&#8217;s good enough as a starting point for somebody looking to act rather than debate. The authors do overreach a bit and claim to provide &#8220;a clear perspective on the <em>whole</em> trend, not just pieces of it, with clear strategic recommendations.&#8221; Though they do provide lip-service to many &#8220;pieces,&#8221; the bulk of this book is about managing your engagement, as a corporate manager, of the market-facing aspects. But that&#8217;s a pretty big subset of pieces to take on. There is no definitive treatment of the &#8220;whole trend&#8221; yet, but there are better breadth-coverage books. Also, by <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/09/24/strategy-tactics/">my definitions</a>, which are pretty good I believe, the book is not about strategy &#8212; it is about operations and tactics. The strategy book too, has not yet been written.</p>
<p><strong>The Highlights</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do only two highlights.</p>
<p>As I said, the strength of the book is in its treatment of market-facing  aspects, viewed from the point of view of certain categories of corporate managers &#8212; mainly those in marketing, PR, customer support and sales. Three important market-facing roles &#8212; supply-chain, purchasing and HR/talent acquisition &#8212; are not adequately covered. This is not to suggest that the book is irrelevant to other (non-market-facing) functions. Other sorts of managers will find this a very valuable treatment, to the extent that their functional roles are ultimately wired to the market through these first-contact roles.</p>
<p>The book is neatly organized around the groundswell metaphor, and suggests a mental model of the prototypical social-media-enabled human population as an organic entity with a life of its own, with a complex behavioral, structural and functional profile, but predictable and capable of  being influenced. The book&#8217;s concepts are arranged around this organic metaphor (more detail in the chapter-wise summary). Highlights:</p>
<p><em>Highlight #1: The Social-Technographics Profile  </em></p>
<p>Much of the data-substance of the book is derived from a compact instrument for understanding the <em>differential</em> characteristics of a population, compared to a sensible default (typically, but not always, the whole population). The analytical method of the book is to start with the people (relevant prosumer, producer or consumer population), and segmenting them into six non-exclusive and non-exhaustive categories, <em>creators, critics, collectors, joiners, spectators</em> and <em>inactives</em>, each defined by a prototypical online social behavior. This is not a personality-psychology segmentation such as the <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/15/the-coming-triumph-of-the-strengths-movement/">Clifton strengthsfinder</a>, but neither is it a vacuous taxonomy of the <em>which Sex-in-the-city character are you?</em> variety.</p>
<p>The value-for-money part of the book is the analysis based on the rich data Forrester has collected around this model. But the key piece that makes this a very smart instrument is the way they use it for differential analysis &#8212; figuring out how one population is <em>different</em> from another, viewed through the lenses of these behaviors. Is population <em>A</em> more or less critical or creative than population <em>B?</em> This creates some actionable leverage and competitive advantage, as opposed to a vanilla undifferentiated strategy that works off broad, base-population analysis, or worse, a one-size-fits-all analysis that assumes everybody will contribute to a wiki, for instance. Very helpfully, the <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Groundswell/index.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.forrester.com');">book&#8217;s website</a> has provided samples for reviewers to use. Here is one:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/groundswell_figure_3-4.jpg" alt="SocTechExample" /></p>
<p>Take a moment to understand how to read that chart. Example: 48% of all US adults are spectators (they consume social media), while 67% of men aged 18-27 are likely to be spectators, which is 139% of the base, in relative terms.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s the kind of market intelligence around which you can build an engagement strategy.</p>
<p><em>Highlight #2: A Day In the Life of the Ubiquitous Groundswell</em></p>
<p>This is a cute, but seriously thought-provoking little two-page story  in the last chapter of the book. It imagines the workday of a senior manager coming into work on December 1, 2012, and smartly using groundswell listening/talking technologies/practices to very rapidly react to a fashion trend, sparked by a Paris Hilton-like character (hilariously named Helena Trampp; suggesting Ivana Trump as well) by introducing a new line of mauve shoes, with an amped up product-lifecycle <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/11/25/clockspeed-and-business-genetics-reconsidered/">clockspeed</a>. It is a neat illustration of the possibility of business models that can take advantage of even very short-window revenue opportunities.</p>
<p>This story concretely illustrates the assertion made by <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/05/01/jump-point-by-tom-hayes/">Tom Hayes in Jump Point</a>, where he points out (serendipitously using an oceanic metaphor in a different way) that the world is not flat; that it is awash in tsunami-like shifts in value generation across the global economic Web. This story graphically illustrates how you might surf on the tsunami to end all tsunamis &#8212; a big, spiky, short-lived fashion-fad.</p>
<p><strong>Quickie Chapter-Wise Summary</strong></p>
<p><em>Part I, </em>comprising three chapters, introduces the broad themes and the social technographics profile, anchored by an image of influencing the groundswell primarily by using its own energies, <em>jujitsu</em> style.</p>
<p>The <em>jujitsu </em>metaphor marks an important point &#8212; the <em>groundswell</em> metaphor isn&#8217;t used in a &#8216;raging oceans&#8217; way (that&#8217;s Tom Hayes&#8217; ocean metaphor) at any time &#8212; think, rather, of a Leviathan-esque creature created by waves (rather like the desert sandstorm creature in <em>The Mummy</em>).  This is probably what made me really like the book, since my own thinking is heavily influenced by Leviathan-like metaphors, and I am working on a book concept based on that style of thinking. The legacy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">system dynamics</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">Jay Forrester</a> style thinking is also evident, but is fortunately underplayed.</p>
<p><em>Part II, </em>comprising 6 chapters, systematically elaborates on this useful &#8216;organic ocean-creature&#8217; metaphor in the first four chapters on <em>tapping, listening to, talking to </em>and <em>energizing</em> the groundswell. The next two chapters cover deeper modes of engagement: <em>helping the groundswell support itself, embracing the groundswell.</em> This part covers everything from management advice, to recommended vendors for different applications, to case studies, and nitty-gritty advice on how to design user review mechanisms.</p>
<p><em>Part III</em> has a passable chapter on <em>how connecting with the groundswell transforms your company, </em>a throwaway/weak one on <em>the groundswell inside your company</em> (by far the weakest chapter), and finishes strongly with a good forward-looking <em>future of the groundswell</em> chapter which contains the little story I highlighted, among other good bits.</p>
<p><strong>Surgeon-General Warnings</strong></p>
<p>So much for the good stuff. As I said, the book is excellent at operational and tactical aspects of managing social media. It is weak in doctrinal and strategic aspects.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>The POST model</strong>: the authors propose the <em>people-objectives-strategy-technology</em> sequence of engagement as axiomatic (&#8221;If you don&#8217;t enter the groundswell with a specific objective, you <em>will</em> fail.&#8221;) While this is a good first heuristic, you&#8217;d do well to be a good deal more experimental in many situations, and navigating with a <em>I&#8217;ll know the value when I see it</em> opportunistic attitude rather than steering by a fixed objective. I&#8217;ve know successful cases where it&#8217;s been TSOP and other permutations.</li>
<li><strong>Mixed messages about agility:</strong> While the book generally advocates agile, plan-as-you-go tactics and iterative, start-small approaches, this message is ambiguously delivered. For instance: &#8220;If an executive is pushing for rapid deployment of a social technology, push back; insist that the effort cannot move forward until you&#8217;ve agreed on a clear objective tied to business goals. &#8221; This suggestion is a recipe for disaster at an experimental/learning stage of capability maturity, and <em>will</em> lead to analysis-paralysis. There are ways to experiment and engage in de-risked ways without clear goals in mind. That&#8217;s another story, however.</li>
<li><strong>False sense of ROI security: </strong>Referring to the same quote, the book also suggests a premature commitment to ROI considerations.  There is significant pressure today to manufacture such evidence, even if it entirely misses the locus of value addition. While this is valuable practice for a more mature era (I am engaged in one such exercise right now), the results should play second-fiddle to qualitative/right-brained considerations. Social media isn&#8217;t yet (and may never be) a drive-by-numbers game beyond isolated operational loci. I would argue that for most social media proposals at most companies, in most functions, ROI calculations are currently impossible even locally, let alone at strategic, enterprise-impact levels. Even the best-practice companies aren&#8217;t that mature in social-media capability. While the book does offer some interesting little sample localized ROI computations, it would be a mistake to insist on an ROI-driven strategy. Fortunately, most of the actual anecdotal examples in the book don&#8217;t exhibit the clarity of purpose that the authors demand.</li>
<li><strong>Dangerous framing of technology:</strong> I&#8217;ve noticed a tendency on the part of consultants to skip over the technology itself as if it were a matter of minor detail. Saying &#8220;it is the people/sociology&#8221; makes you seem wise and above the geeks. True and false. The technology <em>qua</em> technology does not matter. You can leave your geeks to understand and work with XML-RPC and Ajax. But the technology <em>as a medium</em> in the McLuhan sense <em>does</em> matter. It shapes the social behavior that it enables, amplifies some things, suppresses others. Possibly the least useful part of the book is a rather insipid formula for dealing with <em>future</em> technologies. It is mildly insulting to the creativity of technologists to assume you can pre-emptively accommodate and think through any disruption they might throw at you.</li>
<li><strong>Non-recommended uses: </strong>As I said, the book does over-reach a bit in its claims to breadth, so make sure you <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/19/a-map-of-the-world-20-canon/">look for  guidance elsewhere</a> where it is weak. <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/06/13/book-review-wikinomics/">Wikinomics</a> is a good source for understanding the landscape at a doctrinal level. <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/05/01/jump-point-by-tom-hayes/">Jump Point</a> does a good job of conveying the nature of the technology. <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/05/generation-blend-by-rob-salkowitz/">Generation Blend</a> does a nice job with the crucial generational-demographics angle. Nobody has yet written a good treatment of the macroeconomic aspects, but <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/23/ronald-coase-and-salvation-from-anthropological-economics/">there are places to start</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plenty more interesting things to say, but I&#8217;ll stop here. If you are a manager and looking for the operating manual, this is a pretty good first book to buy.

<p class="MsoNormal">For years, scholars and researchers have tried to study genius by giving its vital statistics, as if piles of data somehow illuminated genius. In his 1904 study of genius, Havelock Ellis noted that most geniuses are fathered by men older than 30; had mothers younger than 25 and were usually sickly as children. Other scholars reported that many were celibate (Descartes), others were fatherless (Dickens) or motherless (Darwin). In the end, the piles of data illuminated nothing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Genius is not about scoring 1600 on the SATs, mastering fourteen languages at the age of seven, finishing Mensa exercises in record time, having an extraordinarily high I.Q., or even about being smart. Creativity is not the same as intelligence. An individual can be far more creative than he or she is intelligent, or far more intelligent than creative.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most people of average intelligence, given data or some problem, can figure out the expected conventional response. Typically, we think reproductively, that is on the basis of similar problems encountered in the past. When confronted with problems, we fixate on something in our past that has worked before. We ask, &#8220;What have I been taught in life, education or work on how to solve the problem?&#8221; Then we analytically select the most promising approach based on past experiences, excluding all other approaches, and work within a clearly defined direction towards the solution of the problem. Because of the soundness of the steps based on past experiences, we become arrogantly certain of the correctness of our conclusion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When Charles Darwin returned to <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region> after his famous trip to the <st1:place w:st="on">Galapagos Islands</st1:place>, he showed the finch specimens he found there to distinguished zoologist John Gould. But Gould couldn’t understand the significance. Thinking the way he always thought, he assumed that, since God made one set of birds when he created the world, the specimens from different locations would be identical. As a result, he thought <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Darwin</st1:place></st1:city>’s finches, which looked quite different from the English variety, represented a new species. He missed the textbook case of evolution right in front of him. As it turned out, Darwin who didn’t even know the birds were finches, but because of his unorthodox way of thinking, came up with the idea that shapes the way we see the world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><strong><em>Knowing How to See</em></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Geniuses think productively, not reproductively. When confronted with a problem, they ask &#8220;How many different ways can I look at it?&#8221; <span> </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt">Genius often comes from finding a new perspective that no one else has taken. Leonardo da </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">Vinci believed that to gain knowledge about the form of problems, you begin by learning how to restructure it in many different ways. He felt the first way he looked at a problem was too biased </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt">toward his usual way of seeing things. He would restructure his problem by looking at it from </span>one perspective and move to another perspective and still another. With each move, his <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">understanding would deepen and he would begin to understand the essence of the problem. Da Vinci called this process “knowing how to see.” Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity is, in essence, a description of the interaction between different </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">perspectives. Freud&#8217;s analytical methods were designed to find details that did not fit with t</span>raditional perspectives in order to find a completely new point of view.<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt"> By not settling with one perspective, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt">geniuses do not merely solve existing problems, like inventing an environmentally-friendly fuel; t</span>hey identify new ones. It does not take a genius to analyze dreams; it required Freud to ask in the first place what meaning dreams carry from our psyche.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is the willingness to explore all approaches, even after they have found a promising one, that separates genius from the rest. Einstein was once asked what the difference was between him and the average person. He said that if you asked the average person to find a needle in the haystack, the person would stop when he or she found a needle. He, on the other hand, would tear through the entire haystack looking for all the possible needles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0.15in"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt">Earlier I mentioned Charles Darwin and his work on evolution. I have </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt">become fascinated with scholastic attempts to apply Darwinian ideas to creativity and genius. My </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">own outlook about genius has roots in the works of Donald Campbell&#8217;s blind-variation and selective-retention model of creative thought. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Campbell</st1:place></st1:city></st1:country-region> was not the first to see the connection between Darwinian ideas on evolution and creativity. As early as 1880, the great </span>American philosopher, William James, in his essay &#8220;Great Men, Great Thoughts, and the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">Environment,&#8221; made the connection between Darwinian ideas and genius. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Campbell</st1:place></st1:city></st1:country-region>&#8217;s work has </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">since been elaborated on by a number of scholars including Dean Keith Simonton and Sarnoff </span>Mednick.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 12.6pt 0.15in 0.0001pt 0in"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">The work of these and many other scholars suggests that genius operates according to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Darwin</st1:place></st1:city>&#8217;s </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">theory of biological evolution. Nature is extraordinarily productive. Nature creates many </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt">possibilities through blind &#8220;trial and error&#8221; and then lets the process of natural selection decide </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">which species survive. In nature, 95% of new species fail and die within a short period of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 12.6pt 0.05in 0.0001pt 0in">Genius is analogous to biological evolution in that it requires the unpredictable generation of a <span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt">rich diversity of alternatives and conjectures. From this variety of alternatives and conjectures, </span>the intellect retains the best ideas for further development and communication. All geniuses produce immense quantities of ideas. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">Thomas Edison held 1,093 </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">patents, still the record. He guaranteed productivity by giving himself and his assistants idea quotas. His own personal quota was one minor invention every 10 days and a major invention </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">every six months. Bach wrote a cantata every week, even when he was sick or exhausted. Mozart </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt">produced more than six hundred pieces of music. Einstein is best known for his paper on </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">relativity, but he published 248 other papers. T.S. Elliot&#8217;s numerous drafts of &#8220;The Waste Land&#8221; </span>constitute a jumble of good and bad passages that eventually was turned into a masterpiece. In a <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">study of 2,036 scientists throughout history, Dean Kean Simonton of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:country-region> of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">California</st1:placename></st1:country-region>, </span><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Davis</st1:place></st1:city></st1:country-region> found that the most respected produced not only great works, but also more &#8220;bad&#8221; ones. Out of their massive quantity of work came quality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 12.6pt 0.05in 0.0001pt 0in">An important <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt">aspect of this theory is that you need some means of producing variation in your ideas and that </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">for this variation to be truly effective it must be &#8220;blind.&#8221; Blind variation implies a departure from </span>reproductive (retained) knowledge. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">In nature, a gene pool that is totally lacking in variation would be totally unable to adapt to changing circumstances. In time, the genetically encoded wisdom would convert to foolishness, with consequences that would be fatal to the species&#8217; survival. A comparable process operates within us as individuals. We all have a rich repertoire of ideas and concepts based on past </span>experiences that enable us to survive and prosper. But without any provision for the variation of ideas, our usual ideas become stagnate and lose their advantages and in the end, we are defeated in our competition with our rivals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5.4pt 0.3in 0.0001pt 0in"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">How do creative geniuses generate so many alternatives and conjectures? Why are so many of </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt">their ideas so rich and varied? How do they produce the &#8220;blind&#8221; variations that lead to the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">original and novel? Growing cadres of scholars are offering evidence that one can characterize the way geniuses think. By studying the notebooks, correspondence, conversations and ideas of </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">the world&#8217;s greatest thinkers, they have teased out particular common thinking strategies and </span>styles of thought that enabled geniuses to generate a prodigious variety of novel and original ideas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5.4pt 0.3in 0.0001pt 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5.4pt 0.3in 0.0001pt 0in"><strong><em>Strategies</em></strong><br />
<o:p></o:p><br />
<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">Following are thumbnail descriptions of strategies that are common to the thinking styles of </span>creative geniuses in science, art and industry throughout history. These strategies demonstrate how geniuses get novel and original ideas by incorporating chance or randomness into their creative process in order to destabilize their usual way of thinking and reorganize their thoughts in new ways.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5.4pt 0.3in 0.0001pt 0in"><o:p><em>Geniuses Make Novel Combinations</em><br />
</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 9pt"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">Dean Keith Simonton, in his book <em>Scientific Genius</em> suggests that geniuses are geniuses </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">because they form more novel combinations than the merely talented. His theory has etymology </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt">behind it: cogito&#8211;&#8221;I think&#8211;originally connoted &#8220;shake together&#8221;: intelligo the root of </span>&#8220;intelligence&#8221; means to &#8220;select among.&#8221; This is a clear early intuition about the utility of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">permitting ideas and thoughts to randomly combine with each other and the utility of selecting </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">from the many the few to retain. Like the highly playful child with a pailful of Legos, a genius is </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">constantly combining and recombining ideas, images and thoughts into different combinations in </span>their conscious and subconscious minds. Consider Einstein&#8217;s equation, E=mc2. Einstein did not <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt">invent the concepts of energy, mass, or speed of light. Rather, by combining these concepts in a </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt">novel way, he was able to look at the same world as everyone else and see something different. </span>The laws of heredity on which the modern science of genetics is based are the results of Gregor Mendel who combined mathematics and biology to create a new science.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 9pt"><em>Geniuses Connect the Unconnected</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 9pt 0.1in 0.0001pt 0in"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">If one particular style of thought stands out about creative genius, it is the ability to make juxtapositions between dissimilar subjects. Call it a facility to connect the unconnected that enables them to see things to which others are blind. Leonardo da Vinci forced a relationship </span>between the sound of a bell and the ripples a pebble makes hitting water. This enabled him to make the connection <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">that sound travels in waves. In 1865 F.A. Kekule&#8217; intuited the shape of the ringlike benzene molecule by forcing a relationship with a dream of a snake biting its tail. Samuel Morse was stumped trying to figure out how to produce a telegraphic signal strong enough to be received coast to coast. One day he saw tied horses being exchanged at a relay station and forced a connection between relay stations for horses and strong signals. The solution was to give the traveling signal periodic boosts of power. Nickla Tesla forced a connection between the setting sun and a motor that made the AC motor possible by having the motor&#8217;s magnetic field rotate </span>inside the motor just as the sun (from our perspective) rotates.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 9pt 0.1in 0.0001pt 0in"><em>Geniuses Think in Opposites</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12.6pt"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">Physicist and philosopher David Bohm believed geniuses were able to think different thoughts because they could tolerate ambivalence between opposites or two incompatible subjects. Dr. Albert Rothenberg, a noted researcher on the creative process, identified this ability in a wide </span>variety of geniuses including Einstein, Mozart, Edison, Pasteur, Joseph Conrad, and Picasso in <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">his 1990 book The Emerging Goddess: The Creative Process in Art, Science and Other Fields. Physicist Niels Bohr believed that if you held opposites together, then you suspend your thought and your mind moves to a new level. The suspension of thought allows an intelligence beyond thought to act and create a new form. The swirling of opposites creates the conditions for a new </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">point of view to bubble freely from your mind. Bohr&#8217;s ability to imagine light as both a particle </span>and a wave led to his conception of the principle of complementarity. Thomas Edison&#8217;s invention <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt">of a practical system of lighting involved combining wiring in parallel circuits with high </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">resistance filaments in his bulbs, two things that were not considered possible by conventional </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt">thinkers, in fact were not considered at all because of an assumed incompatibility. Because </span><st1:place w:st="on"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">Edison</span></st1:place><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt"> could tolerate the ambivalence between two incompatible things, he could see the </span>relationship that led to his breakthrough.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12.6pt"><em>Geniuses Look in Other Worlds</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aristotle considered metaphor a sign of genius, believing that the individual who had the<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt"> capacity to perceive resemblances between two separate areas of existence and link them together </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt">was a person of special gifts. If unlike things are really alike in some ways, perhaps, they are so in others. Alexander Graham Bell observed the comparison between the inner workings of the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">ear and the movement of a stout piece of membrane to move steel and conceived the telephone. </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">Thomas Edison invented the phonograph, in one day, after developing an analogy between a toy funnel and the motions of a paper man and sound vibrations. Underwater construction was made </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">possible by observing how shipworms tunnel into timber by first constructing tubes. Einstein derived and explained many of his abstract principles by drawing analogies with everyday </span>occurrences such as rowing a boat or standing on a platform while a train passed by.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p><em>Geniuses Prepare Themselves for Chance</em><br />
</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.15in 0.05in 19.8pt 0in"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt">Whenever we attempt to do something and fail, we end up doing something else. As simplistic as </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">this statement may seem, it is the first principle of creative accident. We may ask ourselves why </span>we have failed to do what we intended, and this is the reasonable, expected thing to do. But the creative accident provokes a different question: What have we done? Answering that question in <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">a novel, unexpected way is the essential creative act. It is not luck, but creative insight of the highest order. Alexander Fleming was not the first physician to notice the mold formed on an </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">exposed culture while studying deadly bacteria. A less gifted physician would have trashed this </span>seemingly irrelevant event but Fleming noted it as &#8220;interesting&#8221; and wondered if it had potential. This &#8220;interesting&#8221; observation led to penicillin which has saved millions of lives. Thomas Edison, while pondering how to make a carbon filament was mindlessly toying with a piece of putty, turning and twisting it in his fingers, when he looked <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">down at his hands, the answer hit him between the eyes: twist the carbon like rope. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.15in 0.05in 19.8pt 0in"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">This may be the most important lesson of all: When you find </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt">something interesting, </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt">drop everything else and go with it. Too many talented people fail to make significant leaps of imagination </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt">because they have become fixated on some preconceived plan. But not the truly great minds. They don’t wait for the gifts of </span>chance; instead, they actively seek to make it happen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.15in 0.05in 19.8pt 0in"><strong><em>Summary</em></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.15in 0.05in 19.8pt 0in">Recognizing the common thinking strategies of creative geniuses and applying them will make you more creative in your work and personal life. Creative geniuses are geniuses because they <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">know &#8220;how&#8221; to think, instead of &#8220;what&#8221; to think. Sociologist Harriet Zuckerman published an interesting study of the Nobel Prize winners who were living in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1977. She </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt">discovered that six of Enrico Fermi&#8217;s students won the prize. Ernst Lawrence and Niels Bohr </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">each had four. J.J. Thompson and Ernest Rutherford between them trained seventeen Nobel </span>laureates. This was no accident. It is obvious that these Nobel laureates were not only creative in their own right, but were also able to teach others how to think creatively. Zuckerman&#8217;s subjects testified that their most influential masters taught them different thinking styles and strategies rather than what to think.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have previously written about/drawn cartoons about  the <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/05/20/the-evolution-of-work-life/">evolution of work-life attitudes</a>. I also drilled down into the issue within the Gen X framing of &#8216;balance&#8217; using the <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/09/19/work-life-balance-juggling-spinning-or-surfing/">surfing, juggling and spinning plates metaphors</a>. Let&#8217;s now try and visualize the &#8216;work-life blending&#8217; framing. Blending inevitably involves very frequent context switching, so we need metaphors for both the blending itself, and for understanding the context switching. Let&#8217;s talk about it with two graphics. For the blending, the communications-technology metaphor of <em>time-division multiplexing</em> is probably the easiest one to start with. For context-switching, we&#8217;ll use metaphors like <em>unwind</em> and <em>unplug.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/worklifeblending.jpg" alt="worklifeblending.jpg" /></p>
<p><span id="more-278"></span></p>
<p><strong>Blending</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk multiplexing. You do only one thing at a time: &#8216;work stuff&#8217; or &#8216;personal stuff&#8217; and the basic activity pattern of work-life-work-life alternation hasn&#8217;t changed. What has changed is that there is more frequent switching (thereby increasing context switching costs), and also the bleeding of life into work, as I pointed out previously. I also suspect there is more variability in the work-effort intensity levels today than before. You get high-variance stress patterns within a week, as opposed to during occasional crises.</p>
<p>But is time-division multiplexing the only one that works? What communications engineers call <em>frequency-division</em> multiplexing maps most to what we understand as &#8220;multitasking&#8221; or doing more than one thing in parallel. Here there is a gender difference. Men know it cannot really be done. Women think it can. The best we can do is background-foreground multiplexing, where only one activity has &#8220;focus&#8221; at any given time (high-frequency manipulation, like &#8220;typing&#8221;), but we can maintain several activities on the backburner (lower-frequency manipulation&#8230; &#8220;stir the soup every 5 minutes&#8221;). This happens to me when I work at home. I am able to cook non-demanding meals (example: pressure cooker) while working. I am able to put work problems on &#8217;simmer&#8217; while chopping vegetables, if my mind is overheated.</p>
<p>Communications people also talk about <em>code-division multiplexing.</em> This is as close  as we can get to true multi-tasking, where one part of our body is talking one language (mouth, English, cellphone), while another is talking another language (hands, stirring, soup).</p>
<p>But most interesting to me is a mode of blending that pushes the multiplexing metaphor to its limit. I often blend work and life by using whatever slack I have on both ends to do things that help me move towards objectives on <em>both</em> ends. Like combining a work+business trip, or prioritizing projects at work in ways that also help me pursue my hobby of writing this blog better. Or angling for projects that help you develop the skills that would otherwise be relegated to weekends. Call that <em>intention-division-multiplexing,</em> to stay within the metaphor.</p>
<p><strong>Context-Switching</strong></p>
<p>Whatever blending metaphor you use, it is clear that there will be a lot more context-switching costs. Context-switching is itself a metaphor from computer science, referring to a CPU switching between processes. But it isn&#8217;t a good metaphor for our purposes. Here are some meta-metaphors to help us think about context switching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/contextswitch.jpg" alt="contextswitch.jpg" /></p>
<p>Curiously, our most common metaphors for context-switching are drawn from the history of technology.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Unwind</em></strong> is a reference to the classical mechanical age when clock-making represented the cutting-edge of technology. This metaphor has the  benefit of capturing the phenomenonlogy accurately: workday stresses get us &#8220;wound up&#8221; and we do some stretches or drink some wine to unwind. It is particularly apt because it gets at the random nature of getting &#8220;wound up.&#8221; Just like the automatic winder mechanisms of pre-quartz watches could be &#8216;wound&#8217; by random motions, random work events get us slowly wound up. You cannot fight this. The disadvantage is that it doesn&#8217;t capture the &#8220;warm-up&#8221; part of context-switching.</li>
<li><strong><em>Decompress,</em></strong> I suspect, dates to the Great Age of Steam Engines. Again, there is an image of pressure building up as you work. It is at the heart of the title of the novel, <em>Boiler Room.</em> I don&#8217;t like this one, mainly because it seems to apply best to high-stress information work, like stock trading or air-traffic control. There is an image of imminent explosive possibilities that the spring metaphor lacks. This metaphor brings in the &#8220;warm-up&#8221; parts better.</li>
<li><strong><em>Unplug</em></strong> began in the world of music, symbolizing a switch from &#8220;on show&#8221; performance for a large crowd (electronically amplified instruments) to a more intimate acoustic performance. But I&#8217;ve heard people use it to describe more personal context-switching rituals. I like the &#8216;on show&#8217; and &#8216;off&#8217; aspects here. Being at work, especially in a people-facing role, is like being on show. Too much of that, and you just want to go away and hide. This one doesn&#8217;t work for fast context-switching within a blender-lifestyle. It works best for a serious switch, like a weekend. There is a slight possibility that some people use this as a plumbing metaphor, in which case it is an R-rated metaphor, or potty humor.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know how to illustrate <strong><em>detox</em> </strong>as a blender metaphor. This is the most physical of the metaphors, since it usually implies some actual actions, like going to a spa, doing a fruit diet for a day, or doing some yoga. I&#8217;ve only heard women use this one. Men tend to say things like &#8220;I need to get outdoors, do some nature stuff.&#8221; I think there is a gender difference here. Men really do prefer outdoorsy activities as a way to detox. I don&#8217;t really enjoy spas.</li>
<li><em><strong>Off the grid</strong> </em>is not really a blender metaphor. It is rare to hear people talk that way even about vacations. It has more in common with the hippie era <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on,_tune_in,_drop_out" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');"><em>dropping out</em></a> metaphor, signifying deep and possibly permanent disconnection from the technological world. But I like this one, and it works increasingly well as we go more mobile. Occasionally, I&#8217;ll come home from work in the late afternoon, around 3:00 PM, turn off my cell phone, and take a nap, before doing some more work in the evening. That&#8217;s a good &#8216;off the grid&#8217; for me, though my wife hates it when I do that.</li>
<li>A metaphor I&#8217;ve only heard myself use is <strong><em>defrag my mind, </em></strong>which I find to be very evocative for when you&#8217;ve been doing a large amount of complex thinking in a short time. If you&#8217;ve never defragmented your hard drive and watched the little graphic show the red and green sectors clean themselves up, this metaphor will make no sense to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nice thing about these metaphors is that each suggests different context-switching rituals. <em>Unwind</em> suggests physical activity like running, to release tense muscles. Decompress suggests simply doing a few big sighs and exhales. Unplug, in the electrical version, suggests just lazing around (turn the energy off). Detox suggests paying attention to what you are eating and, especially, drinking.</p>
<p>Off the grid is probably the hardest to do. It suggests not checking email and other alert mechanisms. Since most of us today are addicts, that&#8217;s pretty hard.  It suggests putting yourself somewhere where connectivity is physically difficult, like a camping trip or a cruise. I went on a cruise recently, and the hourly cost of the shipboard Internet access was enough to keep me off the grid. We saw a free email checking station in Nassau that we couldn&#8217;t resist though.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>defrag </em>suggests that letting your thoughts settle, and letting go of runaway trains of thoughts is key. For me the way to do that is to tune into a different information source than my own brain. This means TV or a mystery novel. While I am distracted, my thoughts settle and arrange themselves better in my memory.</p>
<p>But none of these metaphors seem to really work for the really high-speed context-switching we  need these days.  The more frequently you shift contexts, the less time you can afford to spend. Pete Sampras is reputed to have taken his game to a whole other level by learning to deeply relax between games and sets.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what a good switching metaphor would be for a true high-frequency blending lifestyle, since our latest technological wave actually suggests that we can <em>never</em> disconnect. Maybe blending comes with an inevitably higher baseline level of stressful connectedness.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the history of innovation, Xerox (where I work) has starred in three stories so far: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Carlson" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">Xerography</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_%28company%29" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">personal computing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docutech" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">production digital printing</a>. The first created the modern workplace, the second destroyed and recreated it. The third, probably the least familiar to end-consumers, since it is an industrial technology, might end up topping the first two &#8212; the technology  is on the verge of dethroning the venerable Gutenberg press.  But that&#8217;s all old hat.  Let&#8217;s talk about  how Xerox is poised to launch a FOURTH history-making disruption (*gasp*, most companies have trouble doing it <em>once</em>): making social media grow up from its chicken-throwing infancy (sorry Facebook widget coders; couldn&#8217;t resist that dig!), and turning the world of services-work upside down. And how, if you have the right skills, <em>you</em> can join my buddies and me in the eye of the perfect  storm. Call this a Job Posting 2.0, or a Kool-Aid infomercial &#8212; I am helping recruit for 3 seriously exciting positions in the lab I work in. The kind for which you should ditch your startup idea.<br />
<span id="more-274"></span></p>
<p><strong>First the Jobs</strong></p>
<p>I am hoping that publicly posting fragments of the &#8216;inside story&#8217; of these job opportunities will attract the kind of seriously heavy-hitter resumes that match the magnitude of the opportunity we are uniquely positioned to go after.</p>
<p>The job descriptions might look ordinary enough in today&#8217;s economy, and are part of an intrapreneurial 18-month-old social-media group within the Documents, Workflows and Services laboratory at the <a href="http://www.xerox.com/innovation/wcrt.shtml" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.xerox.com');">Xerox Research Center, Webster</a> (though we are open to remote-work models for the right people):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/webarchxerox.pdf" title="Experienced Web Architect">Experienced Web Architect</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/soccompxerox.pdf" title="Social Computing Researcher">Social Computing Researcher</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/uixerox.pdf" title="User Interface Designer">User Interface Designer</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Please forward these PDF job descriptions around by the way; even if you aren&#8217;t a match, you may one day be able to say, &#8220;I pointed him/her to the job that led to THAT revolution.&#8221; And feel free to <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/contact/">contact me</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
<p>Those are the sorts of professionals who, at ordinary skill levels, might serve to do routine  enterprise s/w development work, or be capable of launching a run-of-the-mill startup. At the &#8220;seriously-talented&#8221; level we are looking for, this sort of group might be able to create a &#8220;hot&#8221; startup or open-source project. In fact chances are, at the talent levels we want, the potential candidates are <em>already</em> thinking &#8220;startup&#8221; rather than &#8220;job.&#8221; (Hmm&#8230; maybe I should add to the job descriptions, &#8220;If you aren&#8217;t already thinking of a start-up idea that we may have to lure you away from, don&#8217;t apply&#8221;)</p>
<p>So let me explain why you might want to consider these jobs instead. The short answer: we are working on the sorts of fundamental technologies that might, among other effects,  disrupt the very ecosystems within which startups live. Definitely a more exciting idea, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t reveal any details in a public blog post, since we <em>are</em> talking about an early-stage R&amp;D effort, but here&#8217;s what I hope is a tantalizing backgrounder.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media for Grown-Ups</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: startlingly creative though it is, the <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/19/a-map-of-the-world-20-canon/">Web 2.0 revolution</a> so far has largely had an impact in consumer markets.  And on the non-mission-critical (eg. vacation photo-sharing) and even downright frivolous (Facebook chicken-throwing &#8212; fun, admittedly) parts of the consumer marketplace.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the world of business &#8212; both SMBs and enterprises &#8212; is largely integrating these technologies in non-disruptive ways. Even the most sophisticated <a href="http://www.enterprise2conf.com/about/what-is-enterprise2.0.php" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.enterprise2conf.com');">Enterprise 2.0 conversations</a> don&#8217;t seem to expect a truly wall-shattering, foundation-cracking impact on business-as-usual. Window-shattering at best.</p>
<p>All of the conversation today is around what I frankly think is the important, but relatively tame stuff: enterprise-class security for social applications, cheaper cloud-delivered IT, some moderate democratization of decision-making, work and customer-interactions, more transparency and sharing.</p>
<p>It all sounds like &#8220;take the consumer technology, make it a little bit worse, and deploy it as a sop for employees who are grumbling about a better level of technology infrastructure in the public space.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what are we attempting to do differently? For starters, we are not attempting to <em>apply</em> variants of existing social media technologies to enterprise problems. We are attempting to create wholly <em>new</em> technologies based on a first-principles understanding of the enabling capabilities, to change the way people, businesses and entire economic ecosystems <em>work.</em> The operative word is <em>work,</em> not <em>play </em>(though we believe the new model of work we are dreaming up will be as <em>fun</em> as play). Here&#8217;s what we are doing by way of negative definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not  YouTube watching in place of TV in the evenings, or reading blogs instead of the newspaper.</li>
<li>Not catching up with just-discovered high-school friends via Facebook on the weekend.</li>
<li>Not  getting GPS-based mobile-phone recommendations of nearby tourist spots.</li>
<li>Not running the world in a compute cloud, excitingly Matrix-like though that sounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all great things, and I personally appreciate the improvements they&#8217;ve brought to my personal quality of life, but what we are working on is changing the very nature of work itself &#8212; the stuff that takes up most of your waking hours, all the way from 1-person freelancers working out of Starbucks, to the board rooms of large enterprises. And just in time too, it seems, given gas prices.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have a name for it yet, but my personal placeholder term for what we are working on is &#8220;Service-Oriented All-Scale Economics.&#8221; I admit that sounds a little vacuously big-picture, but it describes well the intent of the micro-level  pieces we are putting together.</p>
<p>Of course there is risk. But if our ideas work out, the nascent, clumsy lab prototypes can, we think, trigger a complete re-wiring of the   infrastructure for information work, in the economy at large. <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/06/13/book-review-wikinomics/">Present-day Wikinomics</a> will look tame by comparison. If this works out, we&#8217;ll take on World Hunger for an encore.</p>
<p><strong>Why Xerox?</strong></p>
<p>You are probably asking, <em>why Xerox?</em> You are also possibly asking, <em>why not Google, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, HP or Facebook?</em></p>
<p>All these companies are great, and we deeply admire the playbooks they are bringing to the party, and we&#8217;ve been freely inspired by the best of their ideas and models of innovation. But yeah, we think we have some unique ideas up our sleeve (I can&#8217;t resist a competitive dig &#8212; in case you didn&#8217;t notice, 3 of those 5 &#8220;usual suspect&#8221; companies make most of their money through innovations that started at Xerox, and there&#8217;s a chance a fourth could be <a href="http://www.powerset.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.powerset.com');">dethroned by a baby Xerox spin-off</a>!).</p>
<p>There are things we are positioned to do which they can&#8217;t. Neither can any startup, no matter how smart and creative.</p>
<p>At the micro-level, our group has the serious backing of a very enlightened management chain that knows how to nurture a string of  increasing-magnitude wins into major and complex achievements.  We are small, but with as much room to grow as we are able to show we deserve.</p>
<p>Just a hint about the starting point of our ideas:  Xerox has <em>the</em> deepest understanding and mastery over <em>the</em> fundamental atomic unit of economic life in the information age, the document. From paper-napkin onwards, whether in digital or physical manifestations, whether fragmented into super-fluid sub-atomic XML fragments or bound into frozen, super-atomic books, whether dynamically composed via Web services or printed in just-in-time personalized form, we understand the darn thing with a comprehensiveness and depth that nobody in the world can match. Think of our group as building a particle accelerator to shatter the material reality of the world of work into its smallest pieces, and putting it back together again to generate nuclear power to fuel the next era of work (yeah, I am the metaphor-engineer-in-chief in the group :))</p>
<p>So if you think you can handle the challenge, apply! If you want to help indirectly, forward the jobs to people you think are potential history-makers. And like I said, <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/contact/">contact me</a> if you want to find out more.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article is an introduction to an idea &#8212; outsider innovation &#8212; whose time has come. I&#8217;ll present the idea, and along the way  include short reviews of three fun books about innovation (<em>Thinkertoys</em> by Michael Michalko, <em>Make us More Innovative</em> by Jeffery Phillips, and <em>Awake at the Wheel</em> by Mitch Ditkoff) that belong at what I would call the 101 level. These are books that treat the subject at extremely basic levels, compared to the <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/07/23/disruptive-versus-radical-innovations/">advanced end of the literature</a> that full-time researchers like me try to keep up with (and which I review more often here). I almost decided not to review them,  until I suddenly realized, while taking a walk, why such books are extremely important today in enabling an economy based on true &#8216;innovation everywhere&#8217; principles. Or as I prefer to call it at its current stage of evolution, &#8216;outsider innovation,&#8217; by analogy to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_Art" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">outsider art</a>. If you are an &#8216;insider&#8217; this article should help you prepare for the coming &#8216;outsider&#8217; fueled models. If you are an outsider eagerly awaiting the democratization of innovation, and itching to one-up us smug PhDs, this should help you get started.</p>
<p><span id="more-273"></span></p>
<p><strong>Why This, Why Now</strong></p>
<p>I define outsider innovation as innovation by people outside the formal institutional structures and training/career paths in innovation. Unlike outsider art, which has a patina of legitimization-by-condescending-interpretation about it, outsider innovation, I believe, will eventually displace the insider variety as the dominant source of innovation. Professional innovators will increasingly take on orchestration roles. The economic imperative is clear &#8212; a cadre of trained PhDs working in government, industry and university labs, along with pockets of entrepreneurial/startup culture, is simply an obsolete model, when it comes to dealing with the innovation challenges of today. It just has too many structural problems, including inefficiencies in funding and risk-management, poor access to the real-world data that can drive ideation, poor leverage in driving absorption/diffusion of innovations, and most importantly, criminal levels of underutilization of the creativity and knowledge of people outside the formal innovation systems.</p>
<p>Ideas like <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/08/20/open-innovation-or-is-business-war/">open innovation</a> represent gradualist attempts to address this. While these are important, they are not enough. Two things are needed to enable more radical solutions. The first is the development of adequate technology-enabled-business models that can support  innovation on such a pervasive scale. This is not a trivial challenge, but the answer is emerging, as chronicled by <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/06/13/book-review-wikinomics/">Wikinomics</a> and <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/05/18/megacommunities-and-macrotrends/">Megacommunities</a>.</p>
<p>The second requires the recognition of a harsh truth. Even the best savants among the amateurs need an education. All too often, smart but naive amateurs end up believing (and operating by) comforting ideas along the lines of &#8220;Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten&#8221; that helps them devalue the importance of the innovation training that professionals go through, and the institutional support they rely on. All too often, the professionals shy away from contradicting these ideas, out of a fear of appearing elitist.</p>
<p>The mental models that amateurs operate by &#8212; half-remembered high-school lessons involving Archimedes&#8217; <em>Eureka!</em> moment or the more modern romantic (and extraordinarily atypical) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">tale of the discovery of Ramanujan by Hardy</a> &#8212; are simply not enough to support an innovation-everywhere economy. The world of innovation today, thanks to three centuries of evolution, is so professionalized and optimized for a certain economic environment, that amateurs are extremely unlikely to be able to contribute to it on a large scale without learning a few new skills.</p>
<p>Which begs the question: what sort of education do (current) outsiders need, to enable them to be effective part-time participants in innovation?</p>
<p><strong>The Missing Education Revolution</strong></p>
<p>So we need an education revolution on par with the diffusion of high school education in American around the turn of the century, and college education after World War II. Those education revolutions fueled the growth of America as an industrial-age and high-technology-age power respectively. But though equally demanding in magnitude, simple extrapolation will not work for powering America or any other country to <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/19/a-map-of-the-world-20-canon/">World 2.0</a> power status. You can&#8217;t simply legislate a democratization of the doctoral degree the way the GI bill democratized the bachelor&#8217;s degree. More important, you wouldn&#8217;t want to. The Masters&#8217; and PhD degrees are not logical continuations of the K-12 and undergraduate education pipelines, but were evolved for very different social purposes. Even if you could figure out a way to pay the social costs, this would be dumb, and not actually do the job. The economy already has a PhD glut, and it isn&#8217;t fueling more innovation. Merely more frustrated postdocs and adjuncts in holding patterns, waiting to be absorbed by a formal institutional landscape that will never catch up in job creation. You want a way to deliver innovation education and capability <em>in situ, </em>wherever people happen to be working in the economy, and equip them to innovate as part of their everyday work.<br />
What might such a basic innovation education, perhaps delivered by corporate new-hire training programs, comprise? One answer might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>basics of individual and group creativity (it isn&#8217;t as much of a mystery as laypeople assume)</li>
<li>basics of left-brained individual and organizational processes</li>
<li>basics of right-brained individual and social processes</li>
</ul>
<p>Not enough, but it would be a start. Individual stuff, <em>gemainschaft</em> stuff, and <em>gesselschaft</em> stuff in short. Here are three books that exemplify these three categories of education:</p>
<p><strong><em>Michael Michalko, </em><em>Thinkertoys</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"> <iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1580087736&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>It is a boring piece of unlearning, but it has to be done &#8212; most innovation doesn&#8217;t require impenetrably mysterious subconscious processes. But once you get through the unlearning, the learning of disciplined techniques is a lot more fun. To the extent that amateurs are exposed to disciplined creativity techniques at all, it tends to consist of a few  badly-facilitated brainstorming exercises that actually reinforce the <em>creativity is mysterious</em> assumption. <em>Thinkertoys</em> is a brainstorming-and-beyond compendium of tips and tricks of varying levels of sophistication, supported by interesting anecdotes. Professional researchers/innovators will find that they already employ enough of the tactics (or functional equivalents) for their needs, but there are a few surprises even if you think you know the game pretty well (I liked one called Dali&#8217;s technique). A very useful dip-in-when-you-need-to style reference, for whenever you are stuck, or simply in need of a little cue. For amateurs wanting to break into the innovation game, a more through reading, maybe even cover-to-cover, is recommended.</p>
<p><strong><em>Jeffrey Phillips, Make us More Innovative</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0595484255&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>This is the kind of pragmatic left-brained book you need, to learn to innovate in the real world, as opposed to your bathtub. It is somewhat depressing, the extent to which amateurs believe the completely false <em>better mousetrap</em> model, (the one which says, if you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door). You only need to see the shock on the faces of failed <em>American Inventor</em> contestants to realize how pervasive this myth is.  I even wrote <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/01/22/mousetrap-20-a-comicbook/">a comic-book story</a> about this.</p>
<p>Though Phillips&#8217; book is, to a certain extent, a piece of (honest) marketing for the products and services of his innovation-consulting company (<a href="http://www.ovoinnovation.com/services/trainingconsul.php" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.ovoinnovation.com');">Ovo consulting</a>), the book is nevertheless a very useful introduction to formal innovation management processes. It is primarily written for companies that are trying to build an innovation capability (which we in the hi-tech sector take for granted), but it can also serve as an education for individuals trying to get active in innovation  within companies with already-mature and in-place innovation management systems.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mitch Ditkoff, Awake at the Wheel</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"> <iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1600372953&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, it actually takes a bit of education to get people used to the idea that even within apparently rigid, cold and lifeless institutions, the actual work of innovation is fun, rewarding, and a great <em>social</em> activity, not a lonely struggle against entrenched resisting forces that are out to deny your genius. That is, if you are willing to learn how to manage the sociology.</p>
<p>The book is written as a disarming and apparently simple-minded little parable &#8212; the imagined story of the invention of the wheel, set in Neanderthal times with Flintstonish characters. But the story is actually pretty sophisticated, and effectively communicates some of the principles that more commonly trip up amateurs, like the need to champion your ideas through increasingly sophisticated proof-of-concept prototypes that match the level of investment you are seeking, and consciously engineering buy-in.</p>
<p><strong>The Emerging Model: Reverse Surge Protection<br />
</strong></p>
<p>So where might this brave new world of innovation everywhere, fueled by an outsider-centric culture, look like at capability maturity?</p>
<p>I cannot guess at the answer for the economy at large, but I had an insight into what it might look like within an individual large enterprise recently, during a conversation at work.</p>
<p>Companies with an R&amp;D function and budget usually use the R&amp;D organization in 3 ways today &#8212; to conduct (a shrinking amount of) blue-sky basic research, to conduct more short-term development research, and finally, as surge capacity when operational firefighting calls for deeper subject-matter expertise than front-line employees have. Today, the business cycle drives the ratio of the three. In good times, there is more of the first category. In okay times, the second kind dominates. If the company is struggling, it is all surge capacity use.</p>
<p>The insight I had was this &#8212; underneath the process paraphernalia like online brainstorming tools to engage the rest of the enterprise, the way innovation everywhere will actually come about is via what I call &#8220;reverse surge protection.&#8221; The R&amp;D function will be <em>designed</em> to be understaffed with respect to peak capacity needs, and during good times, the function will be expected to bring people from the rest of the enterprise into research roles in systematic ways (including sabbaticals for non-researchers to the research organization, and researchers orchestrating <em>in situ</em> innovation efforts in departments like manufacturing or sales). In essence, the R&amp;D function will be expected to act as the seed/DNA of innovation rather than the tree, managing the scaling of innovation activity up or down, tracking the constraints of the business cycle.</p>
<p>To make up a somewhat realistic example, if the business model calls for say, investment of 3% of revenues in R&amp;D,  the actually installed capacity will be more like 1.5%, with the average target of 3% being met through the reverse-surge processes. Think of it as an agile, research-on-demand model, rather like Amazon cloud hosting. You run your Website on a single captive server, and call up more servers from the cloud to track demand. The R&amp;D function will be the single dedicated server, the rest of the enterprise would be the on-demand cloud.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for the fresh blood (functionally speaking) to yank us jaded old-mould innovators out of our increasingly ineffective rut.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever used phrases like, &#8220;that&#8217;s serious food for thought&#8221; or &#8220;I need to digest that&#8221; or &#8220;there&#8217;s no meat on that argument,&#8221; you&#8217;ve used the FOOD IS THOUGHT (FIT) conceptual metaphor. In this piece, I hope to convince you that there is no such thing as information overload &#8212; it is an imaginary problem that goes away once you learn to think about information with the FIT metaphor. It takes some time, practice and acceptance of a different approach to getting value out of information. Let me explain.</p>
<p><span id="more-272"></span><br />
<strong>The Metaphor</strong></p>
<p>A conceptual metaphor, for those too lazy to read my short introduction to <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/12/16/sapir-whorf-lakoff-metaphor-and-thought/">the work of George Lakoff</a>, is a systematic, partial mapping between two domains, <em>A</em> and <em>B, </em>that structures understanding of <em>B </em>in terms of the conceptual primitives of <em>A.</em> Conceptual metaphors, unlike the more familiar figurative ones, aren&#8217;t isolated linguistic embellishments &#8212; they are fundamental to thought in pre-linguistic ways. <em>Several</em> parts of <em>A </em>are mapped to parts of <em>B</em> in consistent ways, as in the examples above (more examples if you need them: &#8220;he is hungry for information,&#8221; &#8220;she has a thirst for knowledge,&#8221; &#8220;that&#8217;s a tasty morsel of gossip&#8221;)</p>
<p>Now, you can&#8217;t make up conceptual metaphors from scratch, since they emerge naturally from human thought, but you <em>can</em> elaborate those that already exist. I am going to start that way: by overloading the metaphor in its natural state in English. Here goes (warning, this is a beta construction):</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract, conceptual and theoretical <em>what</em> knowledge is <em>protein</em></li>
<li>Narratives are <em>fats</em></li>
<li>Concrete pieces of <em>what</em> knowledge, such as names and facts, are carbohydrates</li>
<li>Small pieces of information that are essential to functional social existence (such as knowing to dial 911 in an emergency) are the essential minerals and vitamins. I previously explored the idea of <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/05/05/art-for-thought/">art as vitamin A</a>.</li>
<li>Non-fiction books are (generally) high-protein food, your work inbox is largely carbohydrates, novels are fats &#8212; Dickens is good fat, trashy romances are bad fats.</li>
<li><em>How</em> knowledge is the interplay of abstract <em>what</em> (protein)<em> </em>information with concrete <em>what </em>(carbohydrate) information in the context of <em>application</em> (apply the <em>forearm</em> muscle to lift that object, and burn up some glucose; apply the quadratic-root formula to <em>this</em> set of coefficients to produce the answer).</li>
<li>The <em>potential value</em> of knowledge is calorific content</li>
</ul>
<p>Conceptual metaphors are always partial, and highlight some features of a domain while de-emphasizing others. If you use them thoughtlessly, you&#8217;ll extrapolate too far. FIT, for instance, doesn&#8217;t help understand thought processes very well. Beyond a coarse &#8220;digestion is information processing&#8221; mapping, you cannot easily map things like deductive vs. inductive reasoning. Bits, unlike calories, can be reused &#8212; indeed using a piece of information makes it <em>more</em> likely that we&#8217;ll remember it as well, except in specific highly-functional cases like waiter&#8217;s order memories.</p>
<p>The key to using FIT (or any other conceptual metaphor) is to stop using it the moment your mappings start becoming forced or convoluted, and begin getting in the <em>way</em> of clarity rather than enabling it. This is partly subjective of course &#8212; your ability to deal with complex metaphors may exceed your friend&#8217;s.</p>
<p>One apparent weakness, as I&#8217;ll show, isn&#8217;t one really. It may seem like in nutrition, carbohydrates are interchangeable no matter what sort of work you are doing, while information is rather specifically matched to its uses. You can use the same molecule of glucose to play tennis or take a walk, but you can&#8217;t interchange bits that way.</p>
<p>Well, you sort of can, but I&#8217;ll get to that after some practice lessons for you.</p>
<p><strong>Some Example Applications of the Metaphor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use it or lose it: </strong>The &#8220;use it or lose it&#8221; phenomenon is beautifully illuminated. If you gorge on protein (theory) without exercise (burning carbs by using existing protein), it gets eliminated without being stored. Lesson &#8212; application of theory is what breaks the theory down into its constituent categorical primitives and get it assimilated into your world view (integrated into your muscles as they recover). If you go long enough without applying some part of your theoretical knowledge, it starts to atrophy. I was once extremely good at solving trigonometric identities for instance. I am not anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Read more primary sources: </strong>The same lines of reasoning that suggest we eat more raw salads and more home-cooked meals over restaurant or frozen meals, suggest that we should occasionally read original scientific papers (home-cooked meal) instead of pop-science (restaurant meal). That we should occasionally look away from the TV (frozen meal) to look out of the window (fresh salad) instead. The idea of a <em>half-baked theory</em> utilizes a similar mapping.</li>
<li><strong>Eat Complex Carbs: </strong>Why do we instinctively (and correctly, unless you are in the celebrity news business) assume that consuming too much Hollywood gossip is bad, while consuming &#8220;serious&#8221; news is good? Think simple carbs in candy vs. complex carbs in whole-grain bread, and the similarity between glucose spikes versus slow digestion.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Intellectual Obesity: </strong>unused carbs get stored as fat. Hollywood gossip and quality news both end up as stored narrative memory (in one case, the entire Brangelina story, in the other, the history of WW II). Functional information, like a waiter remembering an order, actually gets &#8220;used&#8221; up the way glucose does &#8212; it is not stored.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two examples illustrate the care you must exercise in thinking with FIT, as well as the unusual insights that can result. Who is less healthy: the thoughtful entertainment industry critic who deconstructs the Brangelina story in the <em>New York Times</em>, or the amateur historian-pedant who regurgitates, with zero added value, boring historical tidbits about US presidents at parties? The only reason we think of Hollywood gossip as less healthy is that it is <em>explicitly</em> designed to titillate (candy) rather than inform (whole grains), making it more likely that it will end up contributing to mental ill-health. It takes a lot more care and processing to extract good nourishment out of candy. The metaphor helps us separate out the overall &#8216;too much fat&#8217; issue from the &#8216;good fats/bad fats&#8217; issue.</p>
<p><strong>Using FIT to Reframe &#8216;Information Overload&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Now to the promised application to &#8216;information overload.&#8217; The idea that there is such a thing as information overload is the result of a flawed bit of<em> </em>reasoning that goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information scarcity has given way to information abundance</li>
<li>If there is more information than attention to consume it, there is attention scarcity</li>
<li>Therefore,  the same amount of attention must process more information</li>
</ol>
<p>This is rather like saying, in the FOOD end of the metaphor</p>
<ol>
<li>We&#8217;ve gone from prehistoric hunter-gatherer life to Las Vegas all-you-can-eat buffets</li>
<li>There is more food [in Vegas say, not worldwide] than there is appetite for consumption, so there is appetite scarcity</li>
<li>Therefore, everybody must eat more</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, information abundance and attention scarcity are  real.  Information overload is not. Just because there is too much food at a Vegas buffet doesn&#8217;t mean you have to overeat (though many do). You just have an  easier time satisfying your calorific needs than through hunting or farming. As in Vegas, there will be a lot of waste &#8212; food that&#8217;s sampled and not finished, food that&#8217;s never touched and thrown away.</p>
<p>You might think that information abundance and attention scarcity are just different ways of describing information overload.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Information abundance is a problem for <em>producers.</em> People like me, in short, who have to discipline ourselves. Cooking one new and exciting dish in limited quantities for the potluck is better than making a second pot of mashed potatoes when somebody is already making a first pot.</p>
<p>Attention scarcity also is a problem for producers rather than consumers. I, as a blogger, must try to get your attention. But you, as reader, can choose to tune me out completely and go elsewhere.</p>
<p>The biggest insight from the metaphor is this: <em>you don&#8217;t even have to sample if you don&#8217;t want to, so long as there are a few dishes you like that make up a balanced meal.</em> Indians might <em>like</em> to eat Mexican food, and Mexicans may <em>like</em> to eat Indian food, but each can survive without the other. And actually did for several millenia before the cultures had any contact. Let me translate that back to the information domain.</p>
<p><strong>Curing Information Anxiety</strong></p>
<p>If you are still not convinced, it is probably because you believe the following: that as the flood of information coming at you increases, your processing workload inevitably increases. After all, you have to, at the very least, glance at a news headline or email subject line for a tenth of a second to decide whether or not you want to  process (or eat) it.  Surely, even with the most efficient recommendations from StumbleUpon and all sorts of filtration tools, those tenths of seconds still must add up?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The key to understanding why is to think of <em>information throughput</em> rather than <em>information input.</em> You only need to ensure that enough high-quality information (nutrition) is coming at you so you can add enough value (digestion, information work) to make a living off the throughput-process, and hopefully enjoy it (tasty work).  So yes, it has to be balanced and sufficiently varied (protein, carbs, fats &#8212; theory, facts and history), to allow you to function and make a living, but you don&#8217;t have to experiment and sample unless you want to, or your traditional means of adding information value through your work is under threat. If you are an experienced welder in a great job, and you read nothing, you are probably still safe except from the unlikely event of really advanced robots taking away all high-skill welding jobs.</p>
<p>Remember, I said bits in a sense are as interchangeable as calories? Yes, but only if you are able to give up the idea that you need <em>specific</em> pieces of information. The value of information is only realized through information work, and your bandwidth for information-value-addition is far more sharply constrained than your ability to consume information.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to make bits interchangeable:<a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/12/05/the-fine-art-of-opportunism/"> become an opportunist</a>. So long as you have a rich enough stream of information coming at you, you don&#8217;t need to process it all &#8212; just as much as you can manage. Yes, some opportunities and threats will be missed, but you&#8217;ll find enough to keep you busy, and recover from the punches you don&#8217;t dodge. We dimly recognize this through our ideas of opportunity cost and risk management, but we typically don&#8217;t apply the implications to information processing.</p>
<p>Somehow, most of us still think of information processing in deterministic ways. It took <em>me</em> a very long time to get here. Ten years ago, I had &#8220;pet problems.&#8221; Questions I particularly liked to think about. If I missed relevant information about my pet subjects I&#8217;d get anxious. Today, I am much more opportunistic. I am able to get interested in any problem that I can usefully help resolve. I am able to give up pet problems, confident in the knowledge that others will come along in our information-abundant world.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve read to the end, ironically, this principle applies to even <em>this</em> article. Much as I like it (and liked writing it), not reading it wouldn&#8217;t have hurt you &#8212; chances are high that some other article on information management would have made it through your filters and provided as many healthy calories. But if you want more food for thought from me, try out <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/10/25/an-mba-in-gordons-restaurant/">another of my foodie metaphors</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big and complex problems sometimes do require require big and complex solutions. This thought was hammered home for me powerfully last week by way of a triple-punch: a conference I was attending, a book I was reading, and the earthquake in China. The conference was the <a href="http://www.iriinc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Collaboration_and_Research&amp;CONTENTID=6971&amp;CFID=26148575&amp;CFTOKEN=33102307" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.iriinc.org');">IRI Annual Meeting</a>, where I was part of a panel of speakers on the theme of &#8220;Networked World.&#8221; The theme of the conference was &#8220;Macrotrends Creating Opportunities.&#8221; On the flight out and back, I was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/023060398X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=023060398X" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">Megacommunities: How Leaders of Government, Business and Non-Profits Can Tackle Today&#8217;s Global Challenges Together</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=023060398X" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> by Mark Gerencser, Reginald Van Lee, Fernando Napolitano and Christopher Kelly, all consultants with Booz Allen Hamilton. The book is among the most original, thoughtful and<em> necessary</em> books I have read in a long time. Reading it at this particular conference underlined its importance even more.  As for the earthquake, the deep connections between global and local today also hit home, since a Chinese colleague at work was directly affected. I actually happened to mention earthquakes in my talk to make a particular point, <em>before</em> I caught up with the developing news.</p>

<p>Where I work, at Xerox, overcomplicated/over-ambitious ideas often prompt the remark, &#8220;Let&#8217;s not try to solve world hunger here.&#8221; The remark is usually apt, and leads to productive simplification and pragmatism. What do you do, however, when world hunger really <em>is</em> the problem you want to solve? That&#8217;s what this piece is about.</p>
<p><strong>The Gap<o:p></o:p></strong></p>
<p>So why is original thinking needed here? The story of my own disengagement from big &#8220;causes&#8221; is probably as good an illustration as any. About eight years ago, in my first incarnation as an online writer, at Sulekha.com, I used to write a column called <em>Wide Angle.</em> It was mainly armchair analysis of big, global issues, as best as I could grapple with them. The last column I wrote then was on the notorious <st1:place><st1:placename>Narmada</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype>Valley</st1:placetype></st1:place> mega-dam project (you can find it here: <a href="http://vgr.sulekha.com/blog/post/2000/08/on-the-aid-trail-inside-rural-development.htm" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/vgr.sulekha.com');">Part I</a>, <a href="http://vgr.sulekha.com/blog/post/2000/08/activism-in-the-trenches.htm" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/vgr.sulekha.com');">Part II</a>). It is the only piece I’ve written to date that comes close to real journalism. I hooked up with Ravi Kuchimanchi and Aravinda Pillarimari, of AID (Association for <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s Development), and went on a three-day trip into the interior, underdeveloped regions targeted for submergence by the project. AID had, at the time, allied itself with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medha_Patkar" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">Medha Patkar</a>’s anti-dam movement, the <a href="http://www.narmada.org/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.narmada.org');"><em>Narmada Bachao Andalon</em></a>, which lobbied fiercely (but ultimately, unsuccessfully), against the dam, helped along by celebrity polemicists like Booker-winner Arundhati Roy.</p>
<p>It was a powerfully educational and powerfully discouraging experience for me. The intricate web of conflicting motives, the radicalized atmosphere, with non-profit, business and government entities talking past each other, the rampant public posturing for a polarized media &#8212; the whole circus convinced me that this was not an effective way to solve big problems. Though I returned from my trip and wrote up my piece, the experience was such a damper that I stopped writing the column – what was the point of reading and writing about big issues if no effective ways to act were available? (If you read ribbonfarm.com regularly, you&#8217;ll have noticed that though I range widely over many topics, I rarely touch &#8220;big&#8221; issues).</p>
<p>What bothered me was a trite observation. It seemed to me obvious that the big problems could not be solved by government, private sector, or non-profit players acting unilaterally. These problems would only yield to serious inter-organizational collaboration models.</p>
<p>Yet, creating such models is insanely hard. There is deep cultural suspicion among the three sorts of players. Each sort of actor derives its legitimacy in part by adopting a polarizing stance that paints the others as bad-faith actors. For each, there is a very real danger that collaboration could be viewed as collusion and subversion of mission.</p>
<p>These abstract ideas were sharply defined for me by a single preachy remark that was made at an NBA meeting in Bombay (at the <a href="http://www.tiss.edu/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.tiss.edu');">Tata Institute of Social Sciences</a>) that I observed when I was researching my article. One of the participants (it may have been Medha Patkar herself) said something that included the phrase &#8220;the arrogance of engineers.&#8221; Instantly, the entire room was nodding in sanctimonious agreement, with murmurs of support. As an engineer who rather likes his profession, the remark seriously annoyed me as badly misrepresenting the ethos of modern engineering and industry. I felt an urge to make a sharp remark along the lines of <em>get over yourselves, this isn&#8217;t just your problem; industry has to be part of the solution, and you&#8217;re holding your damn meeting in an institute founded by an industrialist.</em> But alongside the annoyance was a dim realization that unproductive though their framing was, they were engaging a serious and real problem. And that industry couldn&#8217;t solve such problems without them, any more than they could solve the problems without industry.</p>
<p>If I were in the same situation today, I&#8217;d suggest a megacommunity.</p>
<p><strong>Megacommunities as the Solution<o:p></o:p></strong></p>
<p>So let&#8217;s talk about <em>Megacommunities</em>. The book proposes a careful, well-validated and thoughtful model &#8212; the megacommunity &#8212; for public-private-civil collaboration that can actually take on big challenges.</p>
<p>The book covers some familiar examples, such as the differences in the aftermaths of Hurricane Andrew in <st1:state><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:state> and Katrina in <st1:state><st1:place>Louisiana</st1:place></st1:state>, the SARS virus issue, AIDS in <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, preservation of the <st1:place>Great Barrier Reef</st1:place> in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and urban revitalization in <st1:place>Harlem</st1:place>. There are also less familiar examples, such as the case of the gas power project by Enel SpA in <st1:place><st1:city>Brindisi</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Italy (the running example in the book)</st1:country-region></st1:place>. Sprinkled throughout the book are revealing anecdotes and quotes illustrating the sophisticated methods employed by high-influence social entrepreneurs, including Bill Gates and Bill Clinton, and case studies of corporations, like HP, and governments, like that of Florida, which seem to have learned this game of civic engagement. There aren&#8217;t as many viewpoints represented from the non-profit sector, perhaps because the writers honestly accept their situation in the corporate corner of the triangle, and the civil sector perhaps has the most unlearning to do, since win-win is a tough model for them.</p>
<p>But the book isn&#8217;t a string of anecdotes. At it&#8217;s heart is a carefully-conceptualized model of a collaborative meta-organization, the megacommunity. A megacommunity is a sustained working partnership among government, corporate and non-profit actors aimed at solving an ambiguous and hard problem that falls in a zone of overlapping interests. The authors are careful to clarify that they are not talking about unilateral do-gooder/<em>pro bono</em> corporate initiatives, traditional lone-voice activism, adversarial negotiations or traditional public-private partnerships of the sort you might see around a  very specific objective like a subway project for instance. The conceptual model is neatly illustrated by this graphic (taken from <a href="http://www.megacommunities.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.megacommunities.com');">www.megacommunities.com</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/mega-book_triangle.jpg" alt="Triangle" /></p>
<p>The graphic emphasizes the key distinguishing feature of the megacommunity construct &#8212; it is a separate-but-equal <em>dynamic</em>, constantly-negotiated partnership of the three sorts of players that productively engage each other via their bilateral levers of influence, which include potentially aggressive ones such as regulations and boycotts. The construct is one of dynamic tension, but not a model of conflict management. It is, rather, a design for a learning community that gradually discovers how to frame and solve the big problem, through small victories that simultaneously build trust and deliver visible progress. It is a model that builds on the strengths of each of the players &#8212; the nuanced decision-making capabilities of the public sector, the operational sophistication and resource management capabilities of the corporate sector, and the social presence, relationships and credibility of the civil sector.</p>
<p>What is special about this idea is that it asserts that it is possible, through disciplined trust-building mechanisms, to make a megacommunity a stable social network, and a locus for the accumulation of enough social capital to make a difference. There is serious thought behind this model. It does not require players to have the same objectives, or even strongly aligned ones. Just overlapping interest in the same focal area, possibly even with diametrically-opposed intentions. One of the most important departures from traditional models of cross-sector engagement is in the flexibility of terms of engagement. As the authors note, on page 73:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider the static nature of most public-private partnerships (PPPs). In order to negotiate a working relationship, both sides expect to isolate the issue upon which they agree and set rules around engagement on the issue. Thus, when conflicts or new issues arise, PPPs do not generally allow for flexible responses. The terms of engagement have been set from the start, and the design has deliberately excluded change because that would be seen as collusion or abandonment of principle. The relationship is locked down.</p></blockquote>
<p>The megacommunity model, by contrast, explicitly recognizes the ambiguous, constantly shifting nature of truly complex problems, and the need for continuously shifting frames and perspectives in search of creative resolution.  The idea is succinctly captured in a quote from Harvard&#8217;s John Ruggie: &#8220;Life in the world of sustainable globalization is a permanent negotiation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book is carefully structured to serve as both a survey of the state of our global ability to engage big problems (conclusion: poor), as well as a thoughtful operating manual. There is a chapter each on the anatomy of megacommunities and how to think with the model, followed by three chapters on initiating, structuring and sustaining, and leading <em>in</em> a megacommunity. The last is important: due to its network structure, you cannot apply direct leadership models to megacommunities, since the leaders of individual participant organizations do not have formal authority over the others. The style of leadership required is one that allows megacommunity participants to navigate across boundaries and operate in all three cultures (something I talked about in a previous <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/02/19/entrepreneurship-intrapreneurship-and-cross-preneurship/">piece on cross-preneurship</a>).</p>
<p>The roadmap and guidelines are particularly well done. Many big-picture books of this sort conclude weakly with silly check-lists, self-assessment tools and assorted  vacuous process paraphernalia. Or worse, directing readers to a lame website  where effective virtual collective action is expected to miraculously emerge. Thankfully, <em>Megacommunities</em> does not insult the intelligence of readers &#8212; indeed it sets a high standard of expectations on the <em>reader.</em> It seems to assume that the average reader is actually an thoughtful and intelligent person, acting in best-faith ways. I am actually afraid some people who really need to read this book may not be able to process it. And yes, social media are realistically factored in as part of the solution, so this book definitely belongs in my <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/04/19/a-map-of-the-world-20-canon/">World 2.0 canon map</a>.</p>
<p>The last noteworthy element in the book is the description of the role played by Booz Allen Hamilton. Books by principals of consulting firms are all too often thinly-veiled marketing brochures that deliberately misrepresent issues in order to make their role seem necessary. <em>Megacommunities</em> is a refreshing change. The authors clearly care, and yet do not put on holier-than-thou airs. The role they play (and presumably other consulting firms with practices in this area) is to facilitate strategic simulations and war games designed to initiate working relationships across sector boundaries, and seed megacommunities. Presumably they get paid for this (and should). This appears to be a consulting model that, I can honestly say, seems to be about adding real value. We often joke that  consultants charge people to tell them what they already know, or merely create ammunition to justify decisions that have already been made by senior management. This appears to be one role where consultants catalyze, as honest brokers, real change that could not happen without them.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging the Gap<o:p></o:p></strong></p>
<p>What will it take to make the megacommunity approach the default operating mode around large, important issues?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>The IRI conference was a small glimpse of how the world actually sets about tackling big problems today (as well as going after big opportunities, which are too big for any individual company or nation to swallow). The <a href="http://www.iriinc.org" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.iriinc.org');">IRI</a> &#8212; industrial research institute &#8212; is a membership organization of about 200 odd corporations and government agencies that was founded by the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.htm" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/sites.nationalacademies.org');">National Research Council</a> in 1938. At these meetings, senior managers attend to swap notes on how to deal with big challenges. Last week, for instance, the themes addressed were &#8216;energy&#8217;, &#8216;global water scarcity&#8217;, &#8216;globalization&#8217; and &#8216;networked world.&#8217;</p>
<p>In it&#8217;s own way, the forum seemed to me a limited model, given the sorts of ambitious things it presumed to address. It was mildly disheartening to see that such a powerful assembly of senior managers from corporate America could do little more than talk Powerpoint at each other. But the IRI isn&#8217;t atypical &#8212; most meta-organizations of this scale or larger, from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">G8</a>, to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economic_forum" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">WEF</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_social_forum" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">WSF</a>, are able to do little more than produce reports, track metrics, talk too much, and fight too much. <em>Megacommunities</em> should be required reading for the leadership of such bodies, since it offers a way for them to redefine their charters in powerful ways within an ecosystem of megacommunities.</p>
<p>In many ways, the megacommunity model is the first attempt to propose that we really need to think in terms of more complex organizational forms than we are used to, in order to gain traction on <em>problems</em> that are more complex than we are used to.</p>
<p>So back to the question, how do we get there? In my mind the answer has three parts.</p>
<p>First, we need to get beyond the comforting idea that big problems will solve themselves. Adam Smith&#8217;s invisible hand is not enough (it took a moral+capitalist intervention to end slavery). Seductive complexity-theory ideas won&#8217;t do either. I mean here ideas of the butterfly-effect variety &#8212; that small forces applied to the dynamics of systems operating under simple rules can have big and complex impacts. True, but not necessarily the impact we <em>want</em> to have &#8212; emergent self-organization is not necessarily a desirable self-organization.<br />
Having accepted that coordinated and complex action is needed, the second part is  to recognize that the complexity of our organizational designs must be re-calibrated to match the growing complexity of the problems we hope to solve.</p>
<p>And the third part is to just learn to operate this way, one tough example at a time. I have no idea if I&#8217;ll ever get to be part of a megacommunity effort, but I hope I do. It sounds like a heck of an interesting time, and I think I might enjoy what appears to be the prize &#8212; feeling virtuous. Wonder how that feels.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not much of a video game fan, but I&#8217;ve noticed that skills you learn that enable you to kill the aliens at Level 1 often become liabilities at Level 2. Everyday life in a corporation, unfortunately, is not quite as explicit as your favorite video game in signaling level changes. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if one fine day, when you boot up in the morning, you get a big message saying, &#8220;You are now in Level 2&#8243; instead of the Windows welcome screen? Wishful thinking aside, Marshall Goldsmith&#8217;s &#8220;What Got You Here Won&#8217;t Get You There&#8221; is as good a guide as you could hope for, for navigating Level changes in the career game. The book is interesting whether you are an obsessed careerist who wants to &#8220;Get There,&#8221; or merely curious about workplace psychology and sociology (I put myself in the latter bucket; being &#8220;There&#8221; seems like a lot of work, though I don&#8217;t mind occasional tourist visits).</p>
<p align="center"> <iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1401301304&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-266"></span>Goldsmith is an executive coach who specializes in fixing apparently trivial personality failings that, without intervention, often end up derailing promising careers headed towards the C-suite. He does this using the sorts of instruments you&#8217;d expect &#8212; 360 degree reviews and 1:1 sessions. As he explains towards the end of the book, that&#8217;s not the sort of thing you want to do yourself. But what <em>is</em> illuminating is his inventory of the behaviors that tend to do most of the derailing.  A good way to frame what the book is about is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_Window" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/en.wikipedia.org');">Johari window</a> diagram, which is discussed towards the end. Here it is (hopefully self-explanatory):</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/johari_window.PNG" alt="johari window" height="420" width="527" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;d think CEOs-to-be would stumble for profound reasons, but the blind-spot behaviors that seem to need fixing are almost silly. The theory makes sense though &#8212; high-fliers tend to be people who are already comparable as far as raw ability goes, and are clearly unlikely to have crippling and profound problems of the raging-alcoholic or complete-technical-charlatan variety. Daniel Goleman suggested <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/055338371X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=055338371X" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">emotional intelligence</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=055338371X" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> as a potential differentiator for Level 2, but deep emotional stupidity is also likely to be weeded out early in a career. If you believe Goldsmith, what&#8217;s left is trivial, relatively easy-to-fix interpersonal-behavioral tics that most people overlook, because they simply weren&#8217;t show-stoppers in early-career roles.  Here is his list of twenty,  and as you will note, almost all of them are behaviors that might actually work <em>for</em> you in simpler roles, when you are busy establishing credibility for the first time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Winning too much</strong>: Needing to have the winning line in every discussion.  It takes some time to notice that you&#8217;ve actually gained enough trust through what you&#8217;ve done that you can let things go and pick your battles, and that coming across as needing to win is more damaging than the winning itself can offset, beyond a point.</li>
<li><strong>Adding too much value: </strong>When a senior manager jumps in to &#8216;improve&#8217; an idea in a discussion with a thoughtful build or two at <em>every</em> opportunity, as Goldsmith notes succinctly, the idea is improved by 5%, while commitment levels drop by 50%; the report&#8217;s idea now becomes the manager&#8217;s idea, killing motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Passing judgment:</strong> The more credibility you gain, the more careful you have to be in revealing your opinion, especially on trivial things. If you have no authority or influence, voicing well-judged opinions <em>gets</em> you those things, but if you already have them in some measure, even throwaway remarks get taken seriously.</li>
<li><strong>Destructive comments:</strong> the higher you go, the more damage is done by thoughtless  remarks, especially if making them is a habit.</li>
<li><strong>No|But|However: </strong>Being the sort of person whose default reaction to any suggestion or idea is to push back. Symptom: too many sentences with <em>no, but </em>or <em>however</em> in them.</li>
<li><strong>Telling the World How Smart We Are:</strong> Ever feel the urge, when you&#8217;ve just heard a presentation, to add something just to demonstrate that you already know the material and are one step ahead? This is one I <em>have</em> done recently enough for it to be personally embarrassing.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking when angry: </strong>This one&#8217;s self-explanatory. Anger can get you noticed the first time, as someone who cares enough to get mad, but keep getting angry and you&#8217;ll do too much damage to be worth working with.</li>
<li><strong>Negativity:</strong> This is a more comprehensive version of 5. Being the jerk who is always the one to offer the &#8220;It won&#8217;t work because&#8230;&#8221; case.</li>
<li><strong>Withholding Information:</strong> Another self-explanatory one &#8212; if you are holding back information just to use as leverage, rather for good need-to-know reasons, at some point, you are just going to stop adding value in a collaborative setting.</li>
<li><strong>Failing to give credit:</strong> I was on the receiving end of this one a few years ago, so I know how it feels. But what is surprising is how often Goldsmith claims this happens out of simple things like forgetting, rather than active credit-hogging.</li>
<li><strong>Taking credit: </strong>a less forgivable cousin of 10.</li>
<li><strong>Making excuses:</strong> Goldsmith notes the interesting point &#8212; it is not the validity or lack thereof that leads to excuse-making being a derailer. It is the projected perception of being the <em>sort</em> of person who makes excuses. He points out an especially subtle one &#8212; self-labeling (&#8221;that&#8217;s just the way I am, sorry&#8221;), which is <em>still</em> an excuse.</li>
<li><strong>Clinging to the past:</strong> Another self-explanatory one.</li>
<li><strong>Playing favorites:</strong> Goldsmith doesn&#8217;t mean favoritism in the usual sense, but the implicit sort of favoritism that creeps in simply by listening more to some people than to others, even for reasons that aren&#8217;t intended to cut others out. High-resonance Inner Circles may achieve good things, but they also imply disenfranchised Outer Circles.</li>
<li><strong>Not apologizing:</strong> being able to say sorry without qualifications. I suspect this one is the hardest for a lot of people.</li>
<li><strong>Not listening:</strong> Goldsmith points out a very interesting manifestation of this &#8212; senior managers impatiently asking presenters in a meeting to go to the next slide.</li>
<li><strong>Not thanking:</strong> This is another subtle one. Goldsmith means being able to say &#8216;Thank You&#8217; when <em>you</em> are complimented. Most people know to thank others for services/work rendered. But a lot of successful people don&#8217;t know how to respond when complimented, and end up fumbling around with self-deprecating remarks or clumsily returning the compliment. Simply saying &#8216;thank you&#8217; in such situations is a small but powerful signal about the kind of person you are.</li>
<li><strong>Punishing the messenger:</strong> there have been enough cartoons about this. Of the twenty, this is the only one I haven&#8217;t personally witnessed though.</li>
<li><strong>Passing the buck: </strong>this one is covered as an interesting composite: needing to win+ making excuses + refusing to apologize + failing to recognize + punish the messenger+ getting angry. That&#8217;s one horrible behavior then.</li>
<li><strong>It wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;me&#8221;:</strong> Self-limiting self-perceptions/definitions. It sorta makes sense that successful people would make up mental models of their own personalities that become their default reason for refusing to change.</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more valuable stuff in the book, though the discussion of these 20 core bad-behaviors is the most useful part. Be careful if you think you already know what the 20 are about. The book has a lot of great examples that point out non-prototypical and subtle, but <em>common</em> manifestations of these behaviors that you may miss. Nearly every discussion of a behavior is a second-take in a sense, in that it skips over the obvious manifestations you might think of, and focuses on the subtle ones. I found myself surprised by a remark or example in nearly every chapter.</p>
<p>Goldsmith isn&#8217;t too good with abstractions &#8212; the latter part of the book is not as good. Much of it is descriptions of his actual processes as a coach, that he warns you not to attempt yourself. This material could have been condensed down to a single chapter, but runs over several.</p>
<p>But overall, a very worthwhile read. I&#8217;d actually have liked a quick-reference-card version of the book. Maybe I&#8217;ll make myself one.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conversations about <em>&#8216;what is art?&#8217;</em> bore me. Conversations about <em>&#8216;what is art for</em>?&#8217; on the other hand, I find arresting. I have a simple answer that works for me: in the &#8216;food for thought&#8217; metaphor, art is the vitamin A. It is what enables your mind to see. This is not an original take on art &#8212; there is a beautiful little book by John Berger called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140135154?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0140135154" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amazon.com');">Ways of Seeing</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ribbonfarmcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0140135154" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> that explores this attitude. Let me develop this theme by way of an extended riff on three pieces from the art of Amy Lin (all images used with permission. You can see more of Amy&#8217;s art at <a href="http://www.amylinart.com" target="_blank" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.amylinart.com');">her Website</a>).</p>

<p><em>(odd thought it might seem, this is actually the first piece in what I hope will evolve into a series on managing information overload. I hope I piqued your curiosity enough to encourage you to subscribe to my <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/feed/">RSS feed</a>.).</em></p>
<p>I am perhaps an extremist about art-as-seeing, since I believe that without art, you eventually go mentally blind. To the extent that you remain mentally alive without engaging formal art of the museum variety, there is art in everyday life that you just aren&#8217;t consciously noticing. And I don&#8217;t mean the deservedly much-parodied <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDXjnW3nIWg" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.youtube.com');">plastic bag of <em>American beauty</em></a>. I mean art as a fundamental presence in the world, much like gravity.</p>
<p>Amy Lin&#8217;s art, which I recently saw at the always-stimulating <a href="http://www.torpedofactory.org/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.torpedofactory.org');">Torpedo Factory</a> in Alexandria, comprises patterns of dots created with colored pencil, occasionally with dissonant non-dot elements thrown in. The drawings shimmer on the edge between metaphoric and representational. There is abstraction too, but abstraction of a warm, inviting and engaging sort. Not the cool mathematical-referential abstractions of Escher, or the self-important abstractions of the abstract expressionists.</p>
<p>Where does Amy&#8217;s art fit, within an <em>art-as-seeing </em>stance? It is what I call <em>look-through</em> art. It gently amplifies my tendencies to look at the world in particular ways. It equally gently subdues my tendencies to look in other ways. It does not grab me by the scruff of the neck and <em>force</em> me to look at the world a certain way. It does not seduce me into <em>look-at</em> mode for too long. It also does not imperatively summon me to her point of view (that&#8217;s something I call <em>look-as</em> art, exemplified by Dali, in my evolving rough taxonomy  of art-as-seeing that I&#8217;ll write more about later).</p>
<p>Let me illustrate.</p>
<p><strong>Affinity 4.1</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/amy-lin-affinity-4_1-large.jpg" alt="Amy Lin Affinity" /></p>
<p>When I looked at the world before <em>Affinity 4.1</em>, I never thought about broad negative-positive spatial heterogeneities. The prototypes that come to my mind are interstitial negative space, and negative-positive reversal, as in the case of  slices of swiss cheese. But consider the beach. The shoreline represents a different sort of relation between figure (land) and ground (sea), if you will pardon the mixed metaphor there. Would <em>Affinity 4.1</em> work for me if it were <em>not</em> made up of dots, but were simply constructed as two intersecting translucent triangles? No. The interstitial spaces gently bring traditional figure-ground ways of seeing <em>just</em> enough into my mind for me to remember to <em>not</em> see that way. But seeing the beach through <em>Affinity 4.1</em> is unsatisfying, since the Earth is a sphere, and ultimately, organizes land-water in interstitial ways. Even the universe at large appears to have an interstitial spatial organization to it, with galaxies scattered like chocolate chips in the vacuum cookie. <em>Affinity</em> is a way the universe could be, but isn&#8217;t (as far as Stephen Hawking knows). I can see an odd, conceptually-possible universe now that I couldn&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>The increasing density of dots towards the edge and the emergent intersection lines within the dotted create other ways of seeing. I could stare at this for hours.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s try another one.</p>
<p><strong>Space</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/amy-lin-space-large.jpg" alt="Space" /></p>
<p>At first, this is <em>look-at</em> art for me. I see a simple exercise in dissonance. But again, the key is in the gentleness. There is just enough of a suggestion of dissonance to encourage you to abandon that way of seeing. Where <em>Affinity</em> leans towards the abstract, <em>Space</em> is closer to the edge of representation, and definitely metaphoric. This makes me think about the Grand Canyon. As you peer over the edge of the canyon, space organizes itself around you in three ways. There is the <em>edge</em> dimension, there is the <em>descent</em> dimension, and there is the <em>contour</em> dimension. I have been to the Grand Canyon thrice, and each time I have seen it somewhat differently, but not <em>very</em> differently. This is the first time I am seeing it this way. As I stare at <em>Space, </em>my memories start to unpack themselves more richly than I can recall storing them.</p>
<p>Besides the three-dimensionality of canyon space that I see here, I also see dimensions of motion here. There is the busyness of the proceduralist <em>what&#8217;s the next viewing point</em> tourist in the red line going southeast. There is, in the blue dots pouring over the edge, the tentativeness and mild fear of the suddenly stimulated tourist, unused to the sort of extreme spatiality the canyon presents. The blue dots, unlike the red ones, are paths not taken. And finally, there is the spiraling near-timelessness of the hiker&#8217;s light blue path down and back up.</p>
<p>Perhaps the title of the piece suggested this way of seeing my Grand Canyon memories. Perhaps the way of seeing is in the piece, or perhaps it is in my head. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/amy-lin-unknown-large.jpg" alt="Unknown" /></p>
<p>This one is an opaque lens for me for a while. I neither <em>look-at</em> or <em>look-through.</em> The memories of the Grand Canyon train of thought are fresh enough in my mind that I resist seeing that, though <em>downward trails</em> suggests itself.</p>
<p><em>Resist the Sun</em> is the next thought. <em>Eye</em> and <em>ego</em> are also not interesting. As with all of Amy&#8217;s pieces (for me), I suppress some dimensions of seeing relatively quickly. It is the amplification of other dimensions that takes time and meditative visual listening. Note that resisting <em>orange-dot-as-sun</em> is not a matter of resisting a `superficial&#8217; use of the lens and looking for a use that is somehow `deeper.&#8217; It is simply a matter of letting the various dimensions of seeing subside or amplify as they will. There are no shallow or deep ways of seeing. There are just ways of seeing.</p>
<p>I try to see through the blue tendrils by themselves next. Whimsy does not hold my attention (octopus with its head on the left). A thought teases me. Three gossiping women on the lower right. Three newcomers uncertainly waiting for entree into the group on the upper right. A monk carefully cradling a ladybug on the left.</p>
<p>Why did I read personalities and social situations into straggling strings of dots? I reflect on my way of seeing people. I suppose I sometimes consciously or unconsciously read specific interpretable gestures, like crossed arms or strutting gaits. But <em>Unknown</em> foregrounds a more raw dimension of body-language-reading. Perhaps much of my body language processing is at a non-symbolic, non-representational and uninterpreted level. A level where emotion is just geometry. Perhaps I process body language that way. Perhaps that is why I project it on straggling dot-lines. Or perhaps there is a fundamental truth about information here that has nothing to do with me.<br />
